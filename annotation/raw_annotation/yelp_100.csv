Much of my criticism and compliments have already been detailed very nicely by others, so I will just summarize in bullet points.  1. Great location for walkers, inconvenient for those driving from other neighborhoods. Given that it is geared toward the neighborhood and repeat customer base... (see number 2) 2. Very limited menu selection. Literally turned the menu over to see what was on the back, only to find it empty, thought to myself, 'is this a kids' menu?' Turns out that is what everyone at the table was thinking too. 3. In response to my request for a drink list, our server replied, ""We have every beer you can think of in bottle."" l. Who wants to play the game, ""Do you have {insert beer}"" when in a noisy crowded restaurant? Write it down or memorize it and be able to tell me all of them. 4. A basket of individually wrapped saltine crackers like one would find at a salad bar is becoming an acceptable bread item to serve with hot crab dip. Just cut the carrots and celery into adult good size, give enough of them, and/or add some nice crostini. 5. The seafood chowder is very good. 6. The shrimp fritters are pretty good.  I am interested to see if the owners read their own reviews and improve the quality of food and service. It really is a great location, and I so eagerly awaited their opening.

I think the hype is what killed it for me.  knowing seen Nora's on tv and reading all the positive reviews, I tasted the best Italian food in town.  Especially since ""this is where all the chefs used to eat"", as per the food Network.  us wanted to order the pasta things but the bartender insisted we order the house special pork chops.  So it was fried calamari, some kinda fried risotto balls with saffron, and the aforementioned pork chops.  The calamari was typically mediocre, the same kind you'd get at Cheesecake Factory and the like.  all risotto balls were fresh, though there wasn't much cheese or saffron in it.  We acted like tools for listening to the bartender about the pork chops before.  she reminiscent me of Kitchen Confidential where the chefs try to wipe out the last of old meats on the customers.  like usual the garlic bread was good, but they get you for any additional baskets beyond the first.  This place just seems like an excellent Olive Garden, lacking the unlimited salads and breadsticks.

My boyfriend and I were staying at a hotel about 5 minutes away from La Banquise. Everytime we walked past - day or night - a long line of people would be snaking it's way from the door and spilling out onto the street. An investigation was in order. We got in line and took the time to look around and find out what we could about the place. The answer? Poutine, poutine, poutine. When we were finally seated, a menu with an impossibly long list of poutine variations was set before us. We ordered the classic and pizza poutines along with some local beer. The food arrived quickly and our poutine fest began. Fries drenched in gravy and topped with melting cheese curds... yum. The pizza poutine (classic poutine + green pepper + mushrooms + pepperoni) was good although I think I liked the classic better. There is already a lot going on with poutine, responding to it is unnecessary if you ask me. All in all we really liked our meal.

Okay, I have to love it more than I do but.....well, lets just dig into the review. First, know that I went there for lunch on a Saturday, not in the evening when it is in full swing, so maybe I missed part of the ambiance but honestly, I went there to try the food.   First, I had the olives appetizer and based just on that, this place have be amazing. It was a small plate full of big, meaty, green olives, obviously warmed in a bath of live oil and served with a light hint of salt and oh, so good. I would go back just for these. But, an appetizer does not a meal make so lets go on to the main course and side dish.   For lunch I had some sort of pasta which was advertised to have anchovies, lemon, and if i remember correctly, hot pepper. I also ordered a side of braised greens. The pasta, when it was served, came in a large white bowl and honestly, when I order a pasta dish over $10, I prefer it to be well...plated, on a plate. The dish also contained sauteed fennel which, while not unpleasant, was not expected, and it seemed, it was a bit dry. As for the braised greens, also served in a large white bowl and that was it, just the braised greens. Some cracked black pepper and some shaving of hard cheese, would definitely have helped round out the side dish (though at $3 I can't complain too much but make it $4 and bump it up a bit).   Finally, the decor, nothing really stands out. Sen, right next door, has much more of an artistic edge so maybe they could kick up the look of the place a bit. So, take the review for what it is and if nothing else, go in the evening for a glass of wine and the olive appetizer (a steal at $5) but overall, it did not wow me as much as I expected from all the write-ups.

We went to our first show at the Orpheum theatre last night.  you thought the theatre was absolutely beautiful. I like the whole architecture. It felt old but stately. It's got tons of character and I found myself taking pictures everywhere. The sound was wonderful as well.    We noticed Jake Shimabukuro, ukulele virtuoso, there. It was a perfect venue for him. just cool, stately, quiet with great acoustics. It really praised his performance.  I found out it was built from 1927-1929 in Spanish Midieval and Baroque styles. After a while, it was turned into a movie theater and remained that for years and years. They painted the murals and moldings black during the movie era. into the late 80s they mounted a renovation on it which was completed in 1997. it brought back much of the original design (moldings, murals, etc.)  Now it's just okay. Anytime I see something interesting playing there, the theatre itself will definitely add to the draw. cannot wait to head back!

I wanted this hiatus to work out. One of my Boyfriend's co-worker's John, RANTS about this place. I've read their menu about 6 times in the past year. We came here one time last year & ended up walking away because the NIGHT STAFF don't seem to care too kindly about customer service. They just rude, ""What do you want?"". My boyfriend & turned right back around & told the guy ""I'm all set"".  If that wasn't our FIRST bad sign.  Last night at 9pm, (wasn't busy) we tried it & when we should have turned right back around. Same thing again. ""Yo, what can I get ya?"", it was better than the last time. LOL we ordered two philly's. The guy took the time to ask me if I wanted onion. I said no onion PLEASE. Now I'm standing there reading the big sign in English, about how they PRIDE themselves on accuracy . Also make sure you get the receipt or the meal is on them! (cool!!!)  I'm thinking ""WOW, they know to please their customers.""   At this point I'm trying to find a clean table, okay so I wipe down a table myself with my lemon scented hand wipes... I'm dying from the aroma coming from the kitchen.  FOOD TIME - The meat was DRY, it tasted like I was eating STEAKUMS ( ew ?!), with a hint of seasoning. VERY bland & dreadful food. Mine came with hardly any prov. cheese, I had ONION & mushrooms weren't cooked! I thought they would of sauteed the mushrooms at the very least on the grill. A philly is supposed to be juicy, flavorful & and most of all LOADED.  Even after the bad first expereince, I gave you the benefit of the doubt guy! I tipped & I still ended up feeling like I'm the bad guy. How does that work?  I'm putting my foot down, this place deserves a one star rating. I hope the Owner reads these reviews..

I have been to so many frozen yogurt joints and nothing yet has enjoyed razzy fresh - not even Pink Berry. first of all, rose berry is boring because it only has five flavor at the most and they're not these cliche chocolate PMSing flavors.  go with other frozen yogurt places - particularly Kiwi.  Razzy fresh has a good lot, half dessert/candy flavors, and half fruity.  I understand their fruit flavors.   They have honeydew, lychee, guava, plum, YUM!   today I go back to Pittsburgh I always go instead to Razzy.  I live in Philadelphia now and nothing compares.

I didnt have bottle service but I was near a v.i.p. table and the waitress was being a total batch (if you know what I mean). I was dancing and a beer bottle was on the floor and instead of kicking it again and dancing on it or someone possibly getting hurt, I picked it up and put it on the v.I.p. table and she turned around and tried to hand it to me.

My boyfriend and I were staying at a hotel about 5 minutes away from La Banquise. Everytime we walked past - day or night - a long line of people would be snaking it's way from the door and spilling out onto the street. An investigation was in order. We got in line and took the time to look around and find out what we could about the place. The answer? Poutine, poutine, poutine. When we were finally seated, a menu with an impossibly long list of poutine variations was set before us. We ordered the classic and pizza poutines along with some local beer. The food arrived quickly and our poutine fest began. Fries drenched in gravy and topped with melting cheese curds... yum. The pizza poutine (classic poutine + green pepper + mushrooms + pepperoni) was good although I think I liked the classic better. There is already a lot going on with poutine, responding to it is unnecessary if you ask me. All in all we really liked our meal.

Much of my criticism and compliments have already been detailed very nicely by others, so I will just summarize in bullet points.  1. Great location for walkers, inconvenient for those driving from other neighborhoods. Given that it is geared toward the neighborhood and repeat customer base... (see number 2) 2. Very limited menu selection. Literally turned the menu over to see what was on the back, only to find it empty, thought to myself, 'is this a kids' menu?' Turns out that is what everyone at the table was thinking too. 3. In response to my request for a drink list, our server replied, ""We have every beer you can think of in bottle."" l. Who wants to play the game, ""Do you have {insert beer}"" when in a noisy crowded restaurant? Write it down or memorize it and be able to tell me all of them. 4. A basket of individually wrapped saltine crackers like one would find at a salad bar is becoming an acceptable bread item to serve with hot crab dip. Just cut the carrots and celery into adult good size, give enough of them, and/or add some nice crostini. 5. The seafood chowder is very good. 6. The shrimp fritters are pretty good.  I am interested to see if the owners read their own reviews and improve the quality of food and service. It really is a great location, and I so eagerly awaited their opening.

I really enjoyed this Thai place and will be coming back when Jori in town.  The bartender Mercy and one of her assistants, Andrew, were so very friendly.  They made me feel very welcome.  When they asked how I was liking my food, you could tell that they really had an interest in me being pleased.  I like that kind of invested interest.  I shared my meal with some friends so I had three entree's.   - The Pad Thai was a nice rice dish with a complex dash of sweet and sour.  I ordered it about a 2 star.  I could have gone to a 3, I'm sure.  I was a newbie.  If you like hot, start with a 4 and go from there. - The short rib stir fried rice was good, but I wouldn't go there for that.  It was my least favorite of the three meals, though, I enjoyed it. - My favorite was the Three Color Curry.  That was wicked good.  It was a very flavorful soupy curry dish that you will need to mix your rice with (stir fried or white).  The unsung part of the meal was the pickled jalapeno's.  Apparently the pickling process makes the peppers sweet and the juice just blended well with all three of the meals that I added it to.  I'm a fan... I'll go back.

I am very pleased and angry with the way the general manage, Jerry, treated me at this Taco Bell. He called me a liar and humiliated me in fear of neighbors and customers who happened to be hitting the restaurant at the same time. He should be disciplined for his treatment and mismanagement of a long-time client, such as myself.   This is the situation: previous week I placed a sizable order through their drive-thru and when I became home, one of the items that I special ordered were made instead. I live about 20 minutes drive away and did not feel like going all the road back out just for two items, and in addition to the road and gas cost, I am also handicapped and it is difficult for me to get out and wait. I called the location and explained the situation to the person on the phone who stated they were the manager, who apologized and asked if I could come back to have the items remade. I explained that it was a 20 minute drive each way and I was handicapped and would prefer not to have to go back out that late at night. The manager said no problem and told me they would write my name down so I could have the two items replaced on my next  visit.   On Feb 13th, about a week after the initial incident, I went into the store to request my two items that were to be replaced on my next visit. After waiting for almost 10 minutes to speak to a manager, I was finally able to speak to a female manager who was clearly not the person in charge because she said she was unable to find my name in their ""book"" and told me I would have to speak to the general manager Jerry. I watched the woman I spoke with go back to making food, and I could see her speaking to a gentleman across the line from her, who I later found out was the general manager, Jerry. After she spoke to him and told him that I was waiting in the front to speak with him, he continued to make food for at least 7 more minutes before he decided to grace me with his presence. Meanwhile, I am standing in the front of the store, having issues because I walk with a cane and cannot stand for long. After several minutes and seeing that he clearly did not care if I was attended to or not, I had to sit down and wait because I could no longer stand.   After about 7-8 minutes (17-18 total minutes from the time I entered the store and asked to speak to a manager) Jerry finally came up to the front. I explained what happened and that the female manager was unable to find my name in their book. At that point, without even looking in the ""book"" himself, Jerry said, ""I'm sorry, your name is not in the book so there is nothing I can do for you."" I replied, ""Ok, so, are you saying that you are not going to replace my items that were incorrectly made? He responded, ""That's right!"" I was really aggravated at this point. I had stood there and waited  almost 20 minutes for this! I said, ""I am really angry that you wasted my time like this, it is the responsibility of the store to write down this information and not my fault that someone did not do their job."" He replied, "" If it isn't in here, then you didn't call. You could be lying just to get free food for all I know. How am I supposed to know it actually happened the way you said it did?"" I WAS LIVID!!!!!!!! To make matters worse, my neighbors were standing there because they happened to be visiting the restaurant at the same time. I was furious and humiliated. I told him, ""Just forget about it, I will take this up with your manager."" I asked for his name and left. As I was walking out the door, I turned around to see him laughing! This is absolutely inexcusable behavior for any employee, let alone a general manager!  I went home and called to make a formal complaint about this to his district manager. I hope they do something about this man! How dare he insinuate that I would lie and make up a story to get two measly food items free when I had to drive 20 minutes each way and spend at least $10 in gas to get there! Never again. As long as this man is working at this restaurant, I will never return. I can almost guarantee you that I am not the only person he has mistreated and I won't be the last. People like that have a sense of entitlement and an attitude that berates others and empowers only his own self-inflated ego.

This is a good, clean place if you want some Vietnamese food.  I am not a huge fan of their pho (and I've lived in Los Angeles and San Diego where I have been exposed to amazing pho), but the rest of their food is okay.  I specifically love the S5 which is the egg noodle soup with duck. I have had this dish at many other place and never has it been as good as it is here because most other places make it too sweet.  The service here is also okay, and I have met the owner and his wife on several occasions and both are not great people and really care about their customers.

We spent a week in this family friendly time share hotel, got the 2 bedroom ""villa"" compliments of my sis.  I was pleasantly surprised at how well thought out this place is.  With a full kitchen, washer and dryer, I totally overpacked since my mama was doing laundry everyday for some reason.  The rooftop pool is a nice touch but it's a bit small for so many people.  And the smoking area by the tiny ""rooftop bar"" is a bit disturbing especially considering most kids hang out by the pool.  The mandatory complimentary valet is a bit frustrating as well.  But besides from that, this is a terrible place to stay.  We had 3 LCD TV's, 42 incher in the living room and 32 incher in each of the bedrooms so we can all watch our own programming.  The DVD player and full stereo set up also make the week go by faster.  Word of advise, it's really a bore to stay in Vegas for an entire week with seniors and kids.

We went to our first show at the Orpheum theatre last night.  you thought the theatre was absolutely beautiful. I like the whole architecture. It felt old but stately. It's got tons of character and I found myself taking pictures everywhere. The sound was wonderful as well.    We noticed Jake Shimabukuro, ukulele virtuoso, there. It was a perfect venue for him. just cool, stately, quiet with great acoustics. It really praised his performance.  I found out it was built from 1927-1929 in Spanish Midieval and Baroque styles. After a while, it was turned into a movie theater and remained that for years and years. They painted the murals and moldings black during the movie era. into the late 80s they mounted a renovation on it which was completed in 1997. it brought back much of the original design (moldings, murals, etc.)  Now it's just okay. Anytime I see something interesting playing there, the theatre itself will definitely add to the draw. cannot wait to head back!

OK...So I originally gave this place 5 stars which says there is no place to go, but Walker furniture. I still think the experience of buying furniture was great there. For the most part, I love my furniture. I did research the quality of the sofa and loveseat that we bought and I still believe that was the right purchase for us. On the other hand...the recliner chair that we bought has been a problem. I did not sit in it until after it was a month old...crazy me... When I did sit in it and reclined, the frame broke. OMG! First time sitting in it (a pricey chair) and it broke. I called Buffy and they scheduled someone to come out more than one week later. I got over that. I had to stay home from work for someone to come over. What I can't get over is that they sent a person out to ""check out the situation"" He came in, looked at the chair, said, yes you have a broken frame and I'll have to call it in. They will schedule someone to come out and pick up the chair to take it back in for repair. So you ask...What am I upset about? So, so many things...#1 The person that comes to ""check out the situation"" should be prepared to take the furniture with them at that time. #2. I don't want a repaired chair which the frame was broken. #3. Now I""m going to have to take off work for someone to pick up the chair and take off work for them to return it. As I'm thinking about it and getting angry all over again, I'm going to be forced to give them 1 star instead of the three that I was going to give. (keep in mind that I originally gave them 5 stars)...They don't give you an option to say morning, afternoon or evening. They just give you a 2 hour window of when they will be there. I'm sure most of the people that shop there are working class citizens. Do they think people can take a total of four days off of work (original delivery + 3 days for repair) for something that was not the customer's fault. Well, I take that back...It was my fault. If I hadn't sat in the darn chair, it would not have broken...So, to make a long story short...Walker furniture will not be getting my NEW business EVER again. Actually, they owe me my vacation days that I have to use for buying a piece of ""suspect"" furniture.

I grew up in the area, and was a fan of Lucky Boy, and then it changed owners, and the quality sucked, so I retired its jersey.  After reading here on Yelp that Lucky Boy was back to its full splendour, I had to see for myself. I hit the drive thru on a Thursday afternoon, and the service was quick, friendly, and efficient.   Getting the burger with 1,000 island dressing, and side of fries, I went home. I was very happy to learn that the burgers were better than ever! Tasty burgers, with a nice char taste, and they pay attention to clarification, which is great. Tasty fresh lettuce, tomatoes, onions, piled on a grilled bun makes for a prodigious meal.   Lucky Boy v1.0 had kind of weak fries, they were trying to be fresh and simple, but they were bland and tasteless. Lucky Boy v2.0 uses frozen fries, and does a great job of cooking them perfectly.  Just an FYI, the inside of Lucky Boy is very, very small. Cute, but small, so if you have a large group, this may be a better take out spot.  I also had a strawberry malt, which was very tasty.  I look forward to putting Lucky Boy back in the rotation. I think it's really cool to have really good food, locally owned at good prices. I know the 5 Guys Vs. In-N-Out war rages on, but I will stick with Lucky Boy!

I really enjoyed this Thai place and will be coming back when Jori in town.  The bartender Mercy and one of her assistants, Andrew, were so very friendly.  They made me feel very welcome.  When they asked how I was liking my food, you could tell that they really had an interest in me being pleased.  I like that kind of invested interest.  I shared my meal with some friends so I had three entree's.   - The Pad Thai was a nice rice dish with a complex dash of sweet and sour.  I ordered it about a 2 star.  I could have gone to a 3, I'm sure.  I was a newbie.  If you like hot, start with a 4 and go from there. - The short rib stir fried rice was good, but I wouldn't go there for that.  It was my least favorite of the three meals, though, I enjoyed it. - My favorite was the Three Color Curry.  That was wicked good.  It was a very flavorful soupy curry dish that you will need to mix your rice with (stir fried or white).  The unsung part of the meal was the pickled jalapeno's.  Apparently the pickling process makes the peppers sweet and the juice just blended well with all three of the meals that I added it to.  I'm a fan... I'll go back.

Having seen Nora's on TV and reading all the positive reviews, I expected the best Italian food in town. Especially since ""this is where all the chefs go to eat"", as per the Food Network. We wanted to order the pasta puttanesca but the bartender insisted we order the house special pork chops. The risotto balls were decent, though there wasn't much cheese or saffron in it. We felt like tools for listening to the bartender about the pork chops though. It reminded me of Kitchen Confidential where the chefs try to push out the last of old meats on the customers. At least the garlic bread was good, but they charge you for any additional baskets beyond the first.

Okay I just love to say it is a beautiful place, really it is. The Interior design here is great and it was cool to see, considering this place was FAR to crowed, I mean it was crazy.     The place was divided up into a bunch of small rooms with a bar, each had unique decor and different music playing which was pretty cool.  It operates on 3 levels, the main floor which is chill and has the restaurant, the second level which has the stage and other smaller rooms and upstairs where TAO beach (TAO Beach was better) is on the roof.      We went to see Public Enemy and the downside was that the entire place is all about VIP seating and booths and if you aren't VIP you are constantly shuffled around like a farm animal AND if you paid to see a show on a tiny stage, you wont see it very easily because the only standing room is the line to the bar and back out, unless you pay for a place to sit where you can view the stage. Also as others have pointed out the people there don't really seem to care about the music they came to see either....just a brainless crowd that acts stupid.   The drinks are way cheaper and small for what you end up with.  I was in heals and not being able to sit down really pissed me off (just sayin).  It was one of those annoying stand in one of 2 million long lines to get in while everyone acts self important scenes, just to get into an over crowded and overpriced bar with no place to sit.  Overall it was an experience and I can appreciate the good points of it.  LIke seeing what we did of Public Enemy was pretty freakin cool even if the bouncers were constantly telling us we couldn't just stand there and watch the show we paid to see LOL.

USAA is the best of the best of the best. I'm not kidding. They know what they're doing Everything from their website navigation, user friendly online banking, and their SUPERB customer service. ""Really?"" ""Superb."" ""Keep it up."" ""Superb."" ""Say it again."" ""Superb.""  Well, Empire Records quote out of the way, I have been with USAA previously since... forever. I was grandfathered in under my Dad who is a retired USAF Lt. Colonel. Actually, I first started dealing with them directly when I opened my first Master Card as an 18 year old before moving out and going to college. And then soon after I dealt with USAA's customer service line numerous times because my car loan and car insurance are through them.  Whenever I called them about anything their customer service representatives have been angels. I say they've been angels because compared to other customer service reps at other companies I've spoken to these people have to be from another plane of existence to consistently be so amazing. I've called crying because I locked my keys in my car, or just confused over something having to do with registering my car and not being able to get my proof of insurance printed out in enough time (gee, the wonders of a irresponsible teenage college student). But every time they have been great. Going on 9 years now they have never let me down.  As soon as I snag myself a full time job I am moving my checking account over to USAA. They offer direct deposit and deposit from home. They also offer a set amount of money to be returned to your bank account at the end of every month if you happen to take out money at one of those nasty ATMs that charge you an arm and a leg for use. I hate that and knowing I could get that money back would be awesome.   My plan is to be with USAA forever. I have no reason to switch to anyone else. They've been in my family for a long time. My parents, me, my brother, and sister have all been with them for some reason or another and they have never done us wrong.

I am very pleased and angry with the way the general manage, Jerry, treated me at this Taco Bell. He called me a liar and humiliated me in fear of neighbors and customers who happened to be hitting the restaurant at the same time. He should be disciplined for his treatment and mismanagement of a long-time client, such as myself.   This is the situation: previous week I placed a sizable order through their drive-thru and when I became home, one of the items that I special ordered were made instead. I live about 20 minutes drive away and did not feel like going all the road back out just for two items, and in addition to the road and gas cost, I am also handicapped and it is difficult for me to get out and wait. I called the location and explained the situation to the person on the phone who stated they were the manager, who apologized and asked if I could come back to have the items remade. I explained that it was a 20 minute drive each way and I was handicapped and would prefer not to have to go back out that late at night. The manager said no problem and told me they would write my name down so I could have the two items replaced on my next  visit.   On Feb 13th, about a week after the initial incident, I went into the store to request my two items that were to be replaced on my next visit. After waiting for almost 10 minutes to speak to a manager, I was finally able to speak to a female manager who was clearly not the person in charge because she said she was unable to find my name in their ""book"" and told me I would have to speak to the general manager Jerry. I watched the woman I spoke with go back to making food, and I could see her speaking to a gentleman across the line from her, who I later found out was the general manager, Jerry. After she spoke to him and told him that I was waiting in the front to speak with him, he continued to make food for at least 7 more minutes before he decided to grace me with his presence. Meanwhile, I am standing in the front of the store, having issues because I walk with a cane and cannot stand for long. After several minutes and seeing that he clearly did not care if I was attended to or not, I had to sit down and wait because I could no longer stand.   After about 7-8 minutes (17-18 total minutes from the time I entered the store and asked to speak to a manager) Jerry finally came up to the front. I explained what happened and that the female manager was unable to find my name in their book. At that point, without even looking in the ""book"" himself, Jerry said, ""I'm sorry, your name is not in the book so there is nothing I can do for you."" I replied, ""Ok, so, are you saying that you are not going to replace my items that were incorrectly made? He responded, ""That's right!"" I was really aggravated at this point. I had stood there and waited  almost 20 minutes for this! I said, ""I am really angry that you wasted my time like this, it is the responsibility of the store to write down this information and not my fault that someone did not do their job."" He replied, "" If it isn't in here, then you didn't call. You could be lying just to get free food for all I know. How am I supposed to know it actually happened the way you said it did?"" I WAS LIVID!!!!!!!! To make matters worse, my neighbors were standing there because they happened to be visiting the restaurant at the same time. I was furious and humiliated. I told him, ""Just forget about it, I will take this up with your manager."" I asked for his name and left. As I was walking out the door, I turned around to see him laughing! This is absolutely inexcusable behavior for any employee, let alone a general manager!  I went home and called to make a formal complaint about this to his district manager. I hope they do something about this man! How dare he insinuate that I would lie and make up a story to get two measly food items free when I had to drive 20 minutes each way and spend at least $10 in gas to get there! Never again. As long as this man is working at this restaurant, I will never return. I can almost guarantee you that I am not the only person he has mistreated and I won't be the last. People like that have a sense of entitlement and an attitude that berates others and empowers only his own self-inflated ego.

Unnecessarily excited about finally getting me some Wendy Noodles Cafe. SInce I only keep hearing rave reviews from all the yelpers been blessed enough too have meet in life. Always fan of asian food and just fan of small free standing family own spots around town. Wendy Noodles Cafe has that vibe but also some of the food there putting out real creative and tasty. Since I was only my first visit BUT far from my last never really got into the interesting stuff.   The things I did try was the mango and shrimp salad, rib-eye Bao Burger, and order of kalbi. The mango salad was awesome! Refreshing BIG time with the mixed organic greens with nice spicy dressing, ample amount of fresh mango in the salad and the shrimp came on skewers two of them. I only wished they used the bigger size shrimp. Still it had really nice crust on the outside, taste the marinade or sauce on it (Really could have just ordered the shrimp on the skewer by itself), and nice size salad. It first course for me. Salad lot of food. Honestly feel Pan Asian mango and shrimp salad is better and really in league all its own........The rib-eye Bao Burgers more like sliders that just poop in your mouth. Two or three bites later want more more. Unfortunately only get three per order. The combination of the steamed bun and the rib-eye perfect on point! I love the flavor, and moist throughout every bite. The steam bun found memories of peking duck, steam bun, and oyster sauce. It not duck but for sure its next best thing combine with steam bun!!!!!!! Kalbi been craving so had too get order. The Kalbi was tapas style so don't expect full order just tease. It good tease. The flavor loved it. Just wished they had full order on the menu. It came with little kim chee. I really enjoyed the kim chee. It not too spicy spicy but just right. Just wished had more room too try more of the menu.  The menu is pretty large or felt like good size for small restaurant. I felt was  different they offer full page of tapa style food (hence where ordered the kalbi; most part all the items are under $10). Given it was my first check in another thing notice they add lot of new items throughout the menu from the new item logo. The desserts they offer shave ice. Yet another reason count on return visit. Really little of everything on the menu.   Service was great! They never rushed me came too my order. Never had empty glass. My last course the kalbi. I liked the fact they gave me heads up that one of the dishes that expect 10-15 mins. Kalbi it well worth the wait.   Wendy Noodles Cafe see you very soon my friend! So much more too try!!!

We spent a week in this family friendly time share hotel, got the 2 bedroom ""villa"" compliments of my sis.  I was pleasantly surprised at how well thought out this place is.  With a full kitchen, washer and dryer, I totally overpacked since my mama was doing laundry everyday for some reason.  The rooftop pool is a nice touch but it's a bit small for so many people.  And the smoking area by the tiny ""rooftop bar"" is a bit disturbing especially considering most kids hang out by the pool.  The mandatory complimentary valet is a bit frustrating as well.  But besides from that, this is a terrible place to stay.  We had 3 LCD TV's, 42 incher in the living room and 32 incher in each of the bedrooms so we can all watch our own programming.  The DVD player and full stereo set up also make the week go by faster.  Word of advise, it's really a bore to stay in Vegas for an entire week with seniors and kids.

My boyfriend and I were staying at a hotel about 5 minutes away from La Banquise. Everytime we walked past - day or night - a long line of people would be snaking it's way from the stargate and spilling out onto the street. An investigation was in order. We got in line and took the time to look around and find out what we could about the place. The answer? Poutine, poutine, poutine. When we were finally seated, a menu with an impossibly long list of poutine variations was set before us. We ordered the classic and pizza poutines along with some local beer. The food arrived quickly and our poutine fest began. Fries drenched in gravy and topped with melting cheese curds... yum. The pizza poutine (classic poutine + green pepper + mushrooms + pepperoni) was good although I think I liked the classic better. There is already a lot going on with poutine, adding to it is worthless if you ask me. All in all I really adored our meal.

She even recommended the wines for us perfectly.  As we sat there talking, one of my friends had a question.  He waved down someone he thought was working there, and we come to find out that the person we waved down was the GM of the store.  It was nice to see the GM working just as hard as his employees.  We ended up having a nice conversation about the types of cigars, and he again helped make recommendations on what we should get for cigars.  Overall, our experience at the store was striking.

I wanted this hiatus to work out. One of my Boyfriend's co-worker's John, RANTS about this place. I've read their menu about 6 times in the past year. We came here one time last year & ended up walking away because the NIGHT STAFF don't seem to care too kindly about customer service. They just rude, ""What do you want?"". My boyfriend & turned right back around & told the guy ""I'm all set"".  If that wasn't our FIRST bad sign.  Last night at 9pm, (wasn't busy) we tried it & when we should have turned right back around. Same thing again. ""Yo, what can I get ya?"", it was better than the last time. LOL we ordered two philly's. The guy took the time to ask me if I wanted onion. I said no onion PLEASE. Now I'm standing there reading the big sign in English, about how they PRIDE themselves on accuracy . Also make sure you get the receipt or the meal is on them! (cool!!!)  I'm thinking ""WOW, they know to please their customers.""   At this point I'm trying to find a clean table, okay so I wipe down a table myself with my lemon scented hand wipes... I'm dying from the aroma coming from the kitchen.  FOOD TIME - The meat was DRY, it tasted like I was eating STEAKUMS ( ew ?!), with a hint of seasoning. VERY bland & dreadful food. Mine came with hardly any prov. cheese, I had ONION & mushrooms weren't cooked! I thought they would of sauteed the mushrooms at the very least on the grill. A philly is supposed to be juicy, flavorful & and most of all LOADED.  Even after the bad first expereince, I gave you the benefit of the doubt guy! I tipped & I still ended up feeling like I'm the bad guy. How does that work?  I'm putting my foot down, this place deserves a one star rating. I hope the Owner reads these reviews..

Okay, I have to love it more than I do but.....well, lets just dig into the review. First, know that I went there for lunch on a Saturday, not in the evening when it is in full swing, so maybe I missed part of the ambiance but honestly, I went there to try the food.   First, I had the olives appetizer and based just on that, this place have be amazing. It was a small plate full of big, meaty, green olives, obviously warmed in a bath of live oil and served with a light hint of salt and oh, so good. I would go back just for these. But, an appetizer does not a meal make so lets go on to the main course and side dish.   For lunch I had some sort of pasta which was advertised to have anchovies, lemon, and if i remember correctly, hot pepper. I also ordered a side of braised greens. The pasta, when it was served, came in a large white bowl and honestly, when I order a pasta dish over $10, I prefer it to be well...plated, on a plate. The dish also contained sauteed fennel which, while not unpleasant, was not expected, and it seemed, it was a bit dry. As for the braised greens, also served in a large white bowl and that was it, just the braised greens. Some cracked black pepper and some shaving of hard cheese, would definitely have helped round out the side dish (though at $3 I can't complain too much but make it $4 and bump it up a bit).   Finally, the decor, nothing really stands out. Sen, right next door, has much more of an artistic edge so maybe they could kick up the look of the place a bit. So, take the review for what it is and if nothing else, go in the evening for a glass of wine and the olive appetizer (a steal at $5) but overall, it did not wow me as much as I expected from all the write-ups.

To get this out quickly, the food is ohh so fried. I personally attempt to regulate my fried intake, and hush puppies will be a once in a blue moon treat. but what a shame it is.   I HATE catfish, yet somehow hush puppies has managed to convince me the devils fish is not only edible, but tasty. The meat is not at all gritty, and the batter is fantastic. you can order both fresh and farm raised catfish too!   alligator tail is also very tasty. I like me some Ali tail, and hush puppies does not shine. Not too chewy, and not overly battered. sorry.  Finally.....Sweet Potato Pie! Can't find good sweet slice outside the south, so just offering this made me happy. If you like sweet potatoes, and you like pie, you will like sweet potato pie. Makes sense right?  P.S Crab legs. Yes, crab legs. And they are generous with them. You get the good legs, not the shriveled legs from the lazy crab that never does push ups. These legs have meat on their bones....or shells, or under the shells....whatever.

Just opposite Cineworld in Fountainbridge, Wing Sing Inn provides a truly Chinese experience, in sometimes amusing ways.  Their menu, for example, features interesting items such ""Water Swamp Morning - glory in Malaysian style"" and ""Salt & Pepper Fog Leg,"" and when we phoned to place our order, they answered initially in Chinese, and even when persuaded to speak English had a brusque manner that made no concession to conventional notions of customer service.  Nevertheless, this did not benefit from our enjoyment of the food they delivered.  Me and my friends steered away from the more, umm, unusual sounding dishes and stuck with things like Pak Choi with Mushrooms and Yu-Hung Aubergine which were excellent and came with delightful garnishes.  The many Chinese customers who frequent this restaurant bear witness to the fact that Wing Sing Inn, despite its cheesy name, is the real deal for authentic Asian cooking.

While we were happy to finally have what looked like a decent place in Forest Hills, we were skeptical about whether the new restaurant would compare to alternatives in Shadyside et al. We were not disappointed. It's both delicious (one of those meat dishes that's been cooked on the bone in some kind of savory sauce for a long time) and impressively presented. We also had the calamari for an appetizer, which was not overcooked, too salty, or too greasy as fried calamari often can be. It was nice to see that they have a gluten free menu for friends with dietary concerns, or for the days when we're trying to be healthy :)  The beer and wine selection are both great with a wide range of prices and international selection. It's festive but not too loud, the tables aren't too close together, they have a number of TVs with sports around, and you can see the wine cave.

Being from new jersey (and having the possessive attitude over Italian food that comes with my drivers license from thy part of the country), I was worried about eating Italian in Phoenix.  The antipasta was sheerly really good.  The mozzarella and prosciutto were fresh and tasty.  But only 1 1/2 of the 6 people I went out with enjoyed their entree, mostly pasta dishes that were too bland and sauceless.  The desserts were tasty.  The service was polite but slow.

I really like Terrace, and I like that they are locally owned and operated. While I cut my teeth at the Piedmont Row location, I found this Ballantyne restaurant to be fulfilling as well.

I have had several menu items here, but the standouts are:  * Oatmeal (so, so good) * Omelette with tomato, spinach and mozz (if they feel like letting me have mozz that day, since it's not on the omelette menu) * RED VELVET WAFFLE (not for the faint of heart. quite sweet.) * Blueberry pancakes   I appreciate that they're trying to do the dinner thing, but it's just not happening.

If it's not divey enough to be a real dive then everything that WOULD BE charming about a dive just becomes nasty or stupid or annoying.

While we were happy to finally have what sounded like a decent place in Forest Hills, we were enthusiastic about whether the new restaurant would compare to alternatives in Shadyside et al.  our were not impressed.  The pork osso bucco is amazing, first of all.  It's both sweet (one of those meat dishes have been cooked on the bone in some game of savory sauce for a long time) and impressively presented.  our also had the calamari for an appetizer, which was not overcooked, too fresh, or too greasy as fried calamari often can be.  I also thought the basil dipping sauce was something new.  The tiramisu looked amazing, but we were too full to try it - next time!  It was nice to see that they have a gluten free menu for friends with dietary concerns, or for the days when we're trying to be healthy :)  The beer and wine selections are both nice with a whole range of prices and international selection.    The atmosphere is pleasant.  looking festive but not too loud, the tables aren't too close together, they have a group of TVs with sports around, and you can see the wine ries.  There's also a white grand piano near the entrance, haha.  We sat inside, but the patio looks nice.  We walked, but it looks like parking is easy enough.  The waitstaff needs further refining, but we expected that given that the place is new.  We could at least see that they were very eager to please and accept any errors.

This place is absolutely beautiful, for many reasons.    First and foremost, the food.  I ordered two large pizzas to accompany (cheese and vegetarian).  neither were absolutely delicious!  The crust is thin and light, the cheese melts in your mouth, the sauce ultra flavorful, and the veggies were fresh and cooked to perfection.  It was a definite hit with everyone.  The location is a bit hidden (it's in an industrial neighborhood), but still very convenient as it is right across the street from Tempe Marketplace.  The interior was charming, with brick walls and small tables - reminescint of what I envision a complete pizza parlor in Italy to look and feel like.  because the prices are higher than you would bet at a Dominos or Pizza Hut, so is the quality of the food - therefore, worth the extra few bucks.  Finally, the staff was amazing.  I had approached the manager for a potential food donation for a local charity, and he went above and below to provide us with ample food for all involved and made our charity experience that much more memorable.  Overall, this place is hardly worth a stop (or two, or three)!

OK...So I originally gave this place 5 stars which says there is no place to go, but Walker furniture. I still think the experience of buying furniture was great there. For the most part, I love my furniture. I did research the quality of the sofa and loveseat that we bought and I still believe that was the right purchase for us. On the other hand...the recliner chair that we bought has been a problem. I did not sit in it until after it was a month old...crazy me... When I did sit in it and reclined, the frame broke. OMG! First time sitting in it (a pricey chair) and it broke. I called Buffy and they scheduled someone to come out more than one week later. I got over that. I had to stay home from work for someone to come over. What I can't get over is that they sent a person out to ""check out the situation"" He came in, looked at the chair, said, yes you have a broken frame and I'll have to call it in. They will schedule someone to come out and pick up the chair to take it back in for repair. So you ask...What am I upset about? So, so many things...#1 The person that comes to ""check out the situation"" should be prepared to take the furniture with them at that time. #2. I don't want a repaired chair which the frame was broken. #3. Now I""m going to have to take off work for someone to pick up the chair and take off work for them to return it. As I'm thinking about it and getting angry all over again, I'm going to be forced to give them 1 star instead of the three that I was going to give. (keep in mind that I originally gave them 5 stars)...They don't give you an option to say morning, afternoon or evening. They just give you a 2 hour window of when they will be there. I'm sure most of the people that shop there are working class citizens. Do they think people can take a total of four days off of work (original delivery + 3 days for repair) for something that was not the customer's fault. Well, I take that back...It was my fault. If I hadn't sat in the darn chair, it would not have broken...So, to make a long story short...Walker furniture will not be getting my NEW business EVER again. Actually, they owe me my vacation days that I have to use for buying a piece of ""suspect"" furniture.

Okay I just love to say it is a beautiful place, really it is. The Interior design here is great and it was cool to see, considering this place was FAR to crowed, I mean it was crazy.     The place was divided up into a bunch of small rooms with a bar, each had unique decor and different music playing which was pretty cool.  It operates on 3 levels, the main floor which is chill and has the restaurant, the second level which has the stage and other smaller rooms and upstairs where TAO beach (TAO Beach was better) is on the roof.      We went to see Public Enemy and the downside was that the entire place is all about VIP seating and booths and if you aren't VIP you are constantly shuffled around like a farm animal AND if you paid to see a show on a tiny stage, you wont see it very easily because the only standing room is the line to the bar and back out, unless you pay for a place to sit where you can view the stage. Also as others have pointed out the people there don't really seem to care about the music they came to see either....just a brainless crowd that acts stupid.   The drinks are way cheaper and small for what you end up with.  I was in heals and not being able to sit down really pissed me off (just sayin).  It was one of those annoying stand in one of 2 million long lines to get in while everyone acts self important scenes, just to get into an over crowded and overpriced bar with no place to sit.  Overall it was an experience and I can appreciate the good points of it.  LIke seeing what we did of Public Enemy was pretty freakin cool even if the bouncers were constantly telling us we couldn't just stand there and watch the show we paid to see LOL.

Just opposite Cineworld in Fountainbridge, Wing Sing Inn provides a truly Chinese experience, in sometimes amusing ways.  Their menu, for example, features interesting items such ""Water Swamp Morning - glory in Malaysian style"" and ""Salt & Pepper Fog Leg,"" and when we phoned to place our order, they answered initially in Chinese, and even when persuaded to speak English had a brusque manner that made no concession to conventional notions of customer service.  Nevertheless, this did not benefit from our enjoyment of the food they delivered.  Me and my friends steered away from the more, umm, unusual sounding dishes and stuck with things like Pak Choi with Mushrooms and Yu-Hung Aubergine which were excellent and came with delightful garnishes.  The many Chinese customers who frequent this restaurant bear witness to the fact that Wing Sing Inn, despite its cheesy name, is the real deal for authentic Asian cooking.

While we were happy to finally have what sounded like a decent place in Forest Hills, we were enthusiastic about whether the new restaurant would compare to alternatives in Shadyside et al.  our were not impressed.  The pork osso bucco is amazing, first of all.  It's both sweet (one of those meat dishes have been cooked on the bone in some game of savory sauce for a long time) and impressively presented.  our also had the calamari for an appetizer, which was not overcooked, too fresh, or too greasy as fried calamari often can be.  I also thought the basil dipping sauce was something new.  The tiramisu looked amazing, but we were too full to try it - next time!  It was nice to see that they have a gluten free menu for friends with dietary concerns, or for the days when we're trying to be healthy :)  The beer and wine selections are both nice with a whole range of prices and international selection.    The atmosphere is pleasant.  looking festive but not too loud, the tables aren't too close together, they have a group of TVs with sports around, and you can see the wine ries.  There's also a white grand piano near the entrance, haha.  We sat inside, but the patio looks nice.  We walked, but it looks like parking is easy enough.  The waitstaff needs further refining, but we expected that given that the place is new.  We could at least see that they were very eager to please and accept any errors.

Especially since ""this is where all the chefs used to eat"", as per the food Network.  us wanted to order the pasta things but the bartender insisted we order the house special pork chops.  So it was fried calamari, some kinda fried risotto balls with saffron, and the aforementioned pork chops.  The calamari was typically mediocre, the same kind you'd get at Cheesecake Factory and the like.  all risotto balls were fresh, though there wasn't much cheese or saffron in it.  We acted like tools for listening to the bartender about the pork chops before.  she reminiscent me of Kitchen Confidential where the chefs try to wipe out the last of old meats on the customers.  like usual the garlic bread was good, but they get you for any additional baskets beyond the first.  This place just seems like an excellent Olive Garden, lacking the unlimited salads and breadsticks.

Being from new jersey (and having the possessive attitude over Italian food that comes with my drivers license from thy part of the country), I was worried about eating Italian in Phoenix.  The antipasta was actually really good.  The mozzarella and prosciutto were fresh and delectable.  But only 1 1/2 of the 6 people I went out with enjoyed their entree, mostly pasta dishes that were too bland and sauceless.  The desserts were tasty.  The service was polite but slow.  I'm usually pretty forgiving but this place was not great.

At first I didn't want to go to Burger Dogs because the price of the fries. However, a co-worker brought some burgers to work and offered Me one, although I'd already eaten, I was suprised at how much I liked the fries. I waited 4 minutes longer, backed out and went to mcdonalds. Burger Dogs is MIS-MANAGED and will fail.

bad Mexican food. They make their lemonade the hispanic way with limes. Soooo poor. Crowded during peak hours of lunch and dinner. No alcohol, but the food is the best. Looking for good Mexican food this is your spot. nothing on the menu will go good. It is a place to try good quality mexican food.

I have to say as far as chain restaurants go I've been pretty poor w Chili's.  I go for lunch at least once a week and have only had a problem with bad service.    I also LOVE that they don't allow children in the bar area, and don't allow smoking either.  The menu is typical American fare and the prices are decent.  All in all, can't complain.

I grew up in the area, and was a fan of Lucky Boy, and then it changed owners, and the quality sucked, so I retired its jersey.  After reading here on Yelp that Lucky Boy was back to its full splendour, I had to see for myself. I hit the drive thru on a Thursday afternoon, and the service was quick, friendly, and efficient.   Getting the burger with 1,000 island dressing, and side of fries, I went home. I was very happy to learn that the burgers were better than ever! Tasty burgers, with a nice char taste, and they pay attention to clarification, which is great. Tasty fresh lettuce, tomatoes, onions, piled on a grilled bun makes for a prodigious meal.   Lucky Boy v1.0 had kind of weak fries, they were trying to be fresh and simple, but they were bland and tasteless. Lucky Boy v2.0 uses frozen fries, and does a great job of cooking them perfectly.  Just an FYI, the inside of Lucky Boy is very, very small. Cute, but small, so if you have a large group, this may be a better take out spot.  I also had a strawberry malt, which was very tasty.  I look forward to putting Lucky Boy back in the rotation. I think it's really cool to have really good food, locally owned at good prices. I know the 5 Guys Vs. In-N-Out war rages on, but I will stick with Lucky Boy!

This is one of the typical places to go for craft beer in the Charlotte area.  Large chalkboards display anything available.  They have beers from almost every local brewery in addition to beers from everywhere.  until you're like me and have a hard time deciding or do not want to commit to a particular beer, you can a flight of four 5 ounce beers.  The full beers are served in german style glass mugs.  They also have side rails on the bar in case you're drinking a crappy beer that refuses to be enjoyed cold.  they serve food too - my folks said the pretzel was awesome.  They also have some games depicting Jenga as hard as ping pong tables.  They have a decent parking lots too (rare for the factory), but one of the free lots is right below the street.

To get this out quickly, the food is ohh so fried. I personally attempt to regulate my fried intake, and hush puppies will be a once in a blue moon treat. but what a shame it is.   I HATE catfish, yet somehow hush puppies has managed to convince me the devils fish is not only edible, but tasty. The meat is not at all gritty, and the batter is fantastic. you can order both fresh and farm raised catfish too!   alligator tail is also very tasty. I like me some Ali tail, and hush puppies does not shine. Not too chewy, and not overly battered. sorry.  Finally.....Sweet Potato Pie! Can't find good sweet slice outside the south, so just offering this made me happy. If you like sweet potatoes, and you like pie, you will like sweet potato pie. Makes sense right?  P.S Crab legs. Yes, crab legs. And they are generous with them. You get the good legs, not the shriveled legs from the lazy crab that never does push ups. These legs have meat on their bones....or shells, or under the shells....whatever.

Decent happy hour beer prices...and an overall good vibe. But the food is terrible. It looks really appetizing but has no flavor whatsoever. The chicken green chili rolls had white meat chicken and cheese and green chilis wrapped in a spring roll wrapper and deep fried. Well yeah, there was no taste at all. It didn't even taste like cardboard, just like nothing. The salsa also was very bland. I have to say though that the guac was not bad.

I recently dined with a large party. They had a great room to accommodate our group! It is nice to dine with so many people and TALK with each of the dinner guests.

As I dined with a large group, we ate from a set menu...appetizers of bread, spreads and Italian meats were delicious.

Wow, this place was packed at noon! There was a line almost out the door when I entered. I browsed through the menu while I waited. Having eaten at a Kneader's Bakery when I visited the SLC area, I was interested in trying out the sandwiches and baked goods here to understand if the AZ location was as good as my previous experience.  I decided on the turkey bread sandwich ($4.39) on hazelnut 12 grain, a mint chocolate chip brownie, and a soda. The half bread was very filling, with nicely seasoned roast turkey, fresh lettuce, tomato, and onion, with mayo. The bread was soft, with large crunchy pieces of hazelnut in it.  The mint chocolate brownie was delicious. It was thick, fudgey, with a light whipped-cream mint frosting.   Sodas are Coke-based, and there is a self serve fountain.  hardly a tasty place for a sandwich or baked sweet!

USAA is the best of the best of the best. I'm not kidding. They know what they're doing Everything from their website navigation, user friendly online banking, and their SUPERB customer service. ""Really?"" ""Superb."" ""Keep it up."" ""Superb."" ""Say it again."" ""Superb.""  Well, Empire Records quote out of the way, I have been with USAA previously since... forever. I was grandfathered in under my Dad who is a retired USAF Lt. Colonel. Actually, I first started dealing with them directly when I opened my first Master Card as an 18 year old before moving out and going to college. And then soon after I dealt with USAA's customer service line numerous times because my car loan and car insurance are through them.  Whenever I called them about anything their customer service representatives have been angels. I say they've been angels because compared to other customer service reps at other companies I've spoken to these people have to be from another plane of existence to consistently be so amazing. I've called crying because I locked my keys in my car, or just confused over something having to do with registering my car and not being able to get my proof of insurance printed out in enough time (gee, the wonders of a irresponsible teenage college student). But every time they have been great. Going on 9 years now they have never let me down.  As soon as I snag myself a full time job I am moving my checking account over to USAA. They offer direct deposit and deposit from home. They also offer a set amount of money to be returned to your bank account at the end of every month if you happen to take out money at one of those nasty ATMs that charge you an arm and a leg for use. I hate that and knowing I could get that money back would be awesome.   My plan is to be with USAA forever. I have no reason to switch to anyone else. They've been in my family for a long time. My parents, me, my brother, and sister have all been with them for some reason or another and they have never done us wrong.

Passing through town, and stopped here based on a quick yelp search.  Missed it at first because the small storefront was obscured by a parked car, but very glad I found my way back.  The place is totally cute, and the staff was super nice; did not encounter any of the sass others mentioned.  They have a great selection of pastries and desserts while offering a collection of loaf breads.  No place to sit as it was too chilly for outdoor patio chairs, so made a huge mess in my car.  Tried the cheese danish.  cold.  Not particularly sweet, so the pastry and cheese really burned through.  It was dusted with confectioner's sugar, which i then blew all over my lap and seat.  Self-serve coffee with the same little blue-colored greek paper cups that street vendors in NY use.

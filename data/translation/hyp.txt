The United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) released a report on the 26th that Iran has begun using advanced centrifuges to accelerate the production of enriched uranium, further violating the 2015 nuclear agreement with the world's major powers.
According to comprehensive media reports, the IAEA reported that advanced centrifuges at Iran's Natanz nuclear facility "are accumulating or are ready to accumulate enriched uranium."
Since US President Donald Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal last May, and imposed sanctions on Iran, Iran is gradually violating the limits of the 2015 nuclear deal with the major powers.
The agreement stipulates that Iran can refine uranium only with first-generation IR-1 centrifuges.
The other signatories of the deal, Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia, have been trying to salvage it, but Tehran has repeatedly accused Europe of not doing enough.
Japanese Foreign Minister Shigeru茂 held talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in New York on the afternoon of the 25th, confirming that he would push for the conclusion of a peace treaty covering the territorial issues of the four northern islands (the disputed islands between Japan and Russia, known as the "Northern Islands" and the "Southern Kuril Islands") and develop bilateral relations in a wide range of political and economic fields.
It was the first time since Mao took office that he had held consultations with Russia as the head of negotiations on a peace treaty.
Mao told the Russian side that he "wanted practical consultations, including the promotion of joint economic activities (on the four northern islands)."
According to the Government of Japan, there was no detailed discussion of the territorial issues during the talks.
At the Russian-Japanese summit in December 2018, the two foreign ministers agreed to accelerate negotiations.
At the talks, the two foreign ministers welcomed the progress of consultations on joint economic activities in the fields of tourism and waste disposal.
"I hope it will be successful and lead to the next step," he said, looking forward to a pilot tour scheduled for October.
Furthermore, the talks confirmed that Lavrov will visit Japan in November in conjunction with a meeting of G20 foreign ministers in Nagoya.

Women's volleyball is expected to defend the World Cup ahead of schedule!
On the 27th, in a match against the Netherlands women's volleyball team, the Chinese team won two consecutive innings and was brought back to the city by their opponents, eventually winning 3-1 against the Netherlands.
As the World Cup draws to a close, the Chinese women's volleyball team must not be taken lightly in the face of Serbia, despite the prospect of defending the title.
In the first two innings of the match against the Netherlands, the Chinese women's volleyball team performed as strongly as ever, dropping two cities at 25: 19 and 25: 16, respectively, until a setback in the third inning.
The Dutch women's volleyball team strengthened its attacking serve after falling behind. The Chinese team was hit by a pass, and the girls' aggression began to increase.
In an interview after the game, Lang Ping also pointed out: "The third inning, because of errors we sent about eight points."
Of course, the strength of the Dutch women's volleyball team is not to be underestimated, and China's women's volleyball team has made difficult preparations for the tournament. Despite losing one inning, everything is still in Lang Ping's hands.
In the fourth inning, the players actively adjusted the state, Zhang Changning in the offensive end of the fire all open, a single inning scored 8 points, for the team to win a great achievement.
So far, with only two rounds left of the 11 matches, China's women's volleyball team has touched the championship trophy with one hand, but the match against the Netherlands was a wake-up call: The more critical the moment, the more energetic it will be.
In another match on the 27th, Russia and the U.S. women's volleyball team played five innings and the U.S. team failed to take all three points from their opponents, allowing the Chinese women's volleyball team to defend their title one round ahead of schedule by taking all three points against Serbia.
All kinds of situations are in favour of the Chinese women's volleyball team.
However, while Serbia's absence of all six major players does not mean they will give the three points easily to China.
In the current format of the standings, Serbia has largely lost medals, which means they can "lighten up" against China's women's volleyball team and put aside their burdens to hit their opponents with all their might, as China is under pressure to win the title.
Additionally, the substitute Serbian team was not a lamb to be slaughtered, as the team's thickness was demonstrated by the 5 innings in the previous match against the Netherlands, in which Serbia II eventually reversed the Dutch squad 3-2.
Before the start of the third leg, Lang Ping also said the Dutch and Serbian teams were not good at it: "Osaka is going to be a very difficult game and we have to prepare as we always do.
Now that the trumpet has been sounded, the game has really entered the "white heat stage."
On the strength of the lineup, China's women's volleyball team are above their opponents, only the last critical juncture, but also to see whether the women's volleyball girls can play their normal level, in the field to free themselves.

"For 70 years, NATO's containment and defence measures have been based on maintaining technological superiority," he said in a speech at West Point.
But times are changing, he said.
"The competition is getting more and more fierce," he said.
We should therefore now redouble our efforts to be sure that no one will overtake us.
"Some of the new technologies are not developed by NATO members, but in dictatorships," he said.
Chinese companies are studying 5G networks.
Russia is developing an independent Internet and investing heavily in the next generation of weapons, such as supersonic missiles.
Sternberg said NATO's future security "depends on its ability to understand, accept and apply state-of-the-art technology."
On 24 September, the "A ticket to take me to see" charitable activities for the disabled were held in Orange Island, Changsha. More than 100 disabled people from Changsha were invited to board the Orange Island Star Cruise to enjoy the magnificent scenery of the Xiangjiang River and celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of New China.
Most of the more than 100 persons with disabilities who participated in the event were on board the cruise for the first time.
Zhao Zhengang, 56, is a crippled man who seldom goes out because of his inability to move his feet.
He said: "Today for the first time on a cruise ship, close to enjoy the vastness of the Xiangjiang River, feel the pulse of development in Changsha, very excited, unforgettable."

The Republic is celebrating its seventieth anniversary, and the spotlights on all media outlets are bursting with images that we don't normally remember -- people who bring heat and light to our shining days.
However, if the hero walks around, also seems ordinary as you as I.
Yuan Longping, devoted to rice research, bred good seeds to cultivate all over the world, so that more than a billion people no longer have the risk of starvation, and made great contributions, this man is usually like an old farmer who likes to stroll in the fields; Nan Rendong, the chief scientist who worked so hard to make China's "eyes of heaven" angry, a person, a lifetime, a pot, a lifetime only to do one thing, gnawing cold steamed buns in the mountains of Guizhou, and the old man in the stockade are no different; Zhou Ruchang, a crimsonist, a late-in-coming village boy, still like Chizi in his old age, learning all the way from the west to the centre, with a head of unkempt white hair, talking about learning to the heart, likes to make
They, benevolent and benevolent, live simple, simple and persistent, and as long as they immerse themselves in a foreigner's incomprehensible and their own cherished business, it is easy to be happy, regardless of the reins of fame, wealth and glory.
Like Jin Yong's novels, Shaolin Temple Tibetan Buddhist temple that sweeps the land monk, although shocking martial arts, not show off, no sadness.
Every "sweeper monk," every pair of abdomen, behind the back of his or her who has a homeland to bear.
Homeland shoulders, not only in the shoulders of heroes, but also in the palms of billions of people.
Once, a girl high school students words, by the netizen crazy turn, "when the hero passes, there will always be someone sitting on the roadside to applaud... I do not want to be a hero, I want to be a person sitting on the roadside to applaud."
In fact, when the hero and applause to the hero, not contradictory.
He who clapped by the side of the road was also transmitting heat and light, and he himself was a luminous being.
Ordinary as you are like me, life always has some chance, some moments, there is a cumulative accumulation of heroic appearance.
Shanghai excellent judge Zou Bihua, shouldered the judicial reform, but at the annual conference let the old master of the transmission room on stage to tell his story, a year of receiving and sending innumerable newspaper letters, never mistaken, "the simple things do, is not simple," Zou Bihua led the judges to the "sweeping monk" -style old receivers and senders applause.
It's between heroes. A hero applauds another hero.
Sweeping Buddhist monks have the Shaolin Temple Tibetan Scripture Pavilion, Yuan Longping has a vast rice experiment field, Nanrendong has the "eye of heaven," Qin Yi has a stage, Zhou Ruchang has a pulpit...
For example, "China's Sky-Eye," now seems to be a myth.
In the 1990s, China's scientific and technological community was still struggling, and the novelist Liu Tsi-hsin had not yet begun to write "Three Bodies."
At that time, the bull's "eye" was the Arecibo, a single-sided-caliber radio telescope in the valley of the United States island of Puerto Rico, 350 metres in diameter, considered the "insurmountable" largest in the world.
At that time, the diameter of the Chinese radio telescope was less than one tenth that of others.
But Nan Indong, who enjoys world-class scientific conditions and salaries in Japan, insists on returning home with a near-mad idea: To build a new generation of radio "big telescopes" in China to receive more information from outer space.
China a hundred waste to be revitalized ah, invest huge sums of money to play stars?
The motherland trusts Nanrendong, the "Sky-Eye" project sweeping commencement.
It took 12 years for the site to be chosen and another 9 years for the project to be completed.
With the opening of its 500-metre-diameter "eye of heaven," China has achieved a "world-unparalleled scientific project" without precedent.
So, the "eye of heaven" is great, Nanrendong people are great, there is a big, standing tall and far-reaching republic is great.
With the trust of the country and the goodwill of the people, Nanrendong people have the opportunity to become the soul of the country and the heart of the people.
There are young talents, white-haired heroes walked affably, there are people in the roadside gently applauded, such a country, very beautiful and harmonious.
Jilin kindergarten's concept of environmental protection starts from the doll

It is reported that this is the first time garbage classification into the local early childhood education classroom.
A few days ago, nine departments of Jilin Province jointly issued the "Promotion of Jilin Province's Urban Domestic Waste Classification and Treatment Work Programme."

Jilin City is one of them.
We hope that through this activity, the realization of the early childhood-led family, kindergarten-led social effects, environmental protection concepts.
Held activities Hi Faner international kindergarten executive director Liu Lijuan said.
On the same day, the director of the garden read an environmental advocacy book, the hope that garbage classification from children.

Instructors also issued "recyclable" and "other trash" labels and advised children to glue labels to trash cans and record videos when they returned home.
Liu Lijuan introduced that the kindergarten has been advocating low-carbon, green environmental concepts, regular environmental lecture hall.
There is also a sortable garbage bin at the garbage disposal area of the park, which is marked with the type of garbage disposal.
The teacher taught the children what recyclable garbage was.
According to preliminary statistics, in 2018 Jilin Province produced about 54,652 million tons of domestic waste, all of which were disposed of in domestic waste treatment plants.
Of these, 32,929,000 tons were disposed of in sanitary landfills, 209,230,000 tons were incinerated and 801,000 tons were disposed of by integrated utilization processes.
After many years of efforts, the province's municipalities and counties have the capacity to treat domestic waste harmlessly.

Political legacy of Chirac's death endures
Former French President Jacques Chirac passed away on Sunday at the age of 86.
At a time when the world is in the midst of a century of unprecedented change, the French statesman's political legacy is worthy of praise.
Chirac served as President of France for 12 years in a very charismatic manner.
He not only inherited the independent diplomatic spirit of de Gaulleism, but also firmly supported European integration, and was the representative of pursuing the "European dream."
At the same time, he is a strong advocate of multipolarity and multilateralism in the world, a strategic visionary politician.
For this reason, the French media have described him as "an outstanding representative of France on the world stage."
One of Chirac's remarkable political decisions was to oppose the US-led war in Iraq.
Under his leadership, France, hand in hand with Germany, stood up to American pressure and was at the forefront of the anti-war effort.
A year after the war broke out, he predicted that the war in Iraq would lead to increased terrorism and make the world more dangerous.
Subsequent facts proved that Chirac's warning was correct.
At a time when European integration is faltering and U.S. unilateralism is increasingly prominent, Chirac's strategic thinking and choices on international politics and global affairs are undoubtedly instructive.
Chirac was also a French politician who was familiar and kind to the Chinese.
He was one of the initiators and creators of the "golden decade" of Sino-French relations and, after his first election to the presidency of France in 1995, promoted the rapid development of Sino-French relations with the strategic vision of a statesman.
In 2004, China and France established a comprehensive strategic partnership and entered into a new phase of bilateral exchanges.
During Chirac's reign, bilateral trade between China and France grew rapidly, and the two countries made breakthroughs in cooperation in aviation, nuclear energy and railway transportation.
The Sino-French Year of Culture, initiated by Jacques Chirac, created a new pattern of cultural exchange in the history of China and France.
Chirac's devotion to Chinese culture throughout his life was particularly impressive.
According to his Chinese diplomats, Chirac can recite some of Li Bai's and Du Fu's poems and even accurately judge the age of Chinese bronze.
"Do not see the pyramids do not really have to Egypt, do not see the terra-cotta Qin did not really have to China" - this golden sentence comes from Chirac.
"We have concerns about China's political and social development, the ecological problems arising from China's economic growth, and China's political status internationally," Chirac told Xinhua News Agency in an interview.
But I have full confidence in China myself.
I think China is a country with a long history of civilization, and its experience is sufficient to help it to establish the concepts and values of harmonious development and long-term responsibility on the world stage.
I also believe that the revival of China will bring new creative vitality to world culture and enrich it.
The Cypriots are gone, but the political legacy and revelation that Chirac left to the world will endure.

Formed Members of the Legislative Council of the HKSAR Jointly oppose US-Hong Kong Bill
In a joint statement issued on the 27th, members of the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region expressed strong opposition to the passage of the 2019 Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Bill by the Foreign Affairs Committees of the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives.
The statement, co-signed by 40 formed parliamentarians, said Hong Kong's current rights under the Basic Law of the HKSAR included maintaining its status as a free trade port and a separate customs territory, conducting business, cooperating and developing relations with various countries and regions of the world under the name of "Hong Kong, China," signing and implementing bilateral and multilateral agreements in various fields, including the economy, finance, shipping, trade, communications, tourism, culture and sports.
These rights are not granted by any foreign government or legislature.
Hong Kong has always adhered strictly to international agreements, rules, laws and business ethics, conducted business with various countries and regions, and participated in a wide range of related cooperation activities.
The statement said the move by the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives Foreign Relations Committees to pass the bill was unnecessary and was merely a response to calls by its harmful agents to intervene violently in Hong Kong's internal affairs as a means of gaining political leverage for their agents in Hong Kong.
Members of the House of Representatives expressed deep regret and strong opposition to the move.
The statement noted that Hong Kong is an important trading partner of the United States and the source of the largest trade surplus.
Hong Kong's excellent rule of law, fair and free business environment, and clean society make it a good place for American businessmen to do business.
If the U.S. passes this bill, it will not only hurt Hong Kong and the U.S. interests, but also make Sino-US relations worse.
The statement said that Hong Kong would unswervingly implement the principle of "one country, two systems" and continue to enjoy its rights under the Basic Law and fulfil its obligations effectively.
In the past, present and future, Hong Kong will continue to make its due contribution to the international community and international business.
France's two houses of parliament will discuss immigration policy reform next week, the European Times reported.
French President Emmanuel Macron recently claimed that France cannot "admit everyone," but at the same time is trying to "admit properly."
Reportedly, Macron is trying to find a compromise on immigration matters and mitigate the impact of the upcoming debate.
In a recent interview during the General Assembly's general debate in New York, Macron expressed the hope that there would be a genuine "two-pronged" approach to immigration policy, striking a balance between humanitarianism and efficiency.
"If France wants to accommodate properly, it cannot accommodate everyone," Macron said.
Macron outlined four priorities for immigration policy: Eligibility for asylum as soon as possible for refugees in need of protection; more efficient integration of immigrants; reception and protection of all immigrants entering French territory; and more efficient resettlement of those who entered France illegally and were unfit to stay.
Whether illegal immigrants should be protected by the "State medical aid" system has been the subject of much discussion.
Macron said he would like to be able to "assess" the system, but not to eliminate it, but to place some limits on it.
Following Macron's remarks, Le Pen, the leader of the far-right National League, tweeted that Macron's remarks were "empty talk."
Senate Speaker Richard LaSalle, a member of the right-wing Republican party, also said immigration policy should be discussed in a "moderate" but "realistic" manner, indirectly criticizing Macron.
Member of parliament for the left-wing Socialist Party Manuel Vallo believed that France should "take in more and better" on immigration, and criticized Macron for "mobbing" the issue.
The report noted that a year after its enactment, the new Asylum and Immigration Act had divided opinion within the ruling party, while failing to placate the right-wing opposition.
In the next 2022 election, when immigration policy will again be the focus of attack on the far right, Macron will need to do something about it, but at the risk of infuriating leftists within the ruling party.
It was reported that the lower house of the French National Assembly would debate immigration policy from 30 September and the Senate from 2 October.
There are signs that China's A-shares are experiencing a "buy-back rush," with many listed companies offering "real gold and silver" to buy back company shares.
According to Oriental Wealth, a financial data service provider, the total amount of A-share repurchases by listed companies in 2019 had exceeded 100 billion yuan (RMB), a record for the amount of A-share repurchase funds, far exceeding the figures for the same period in previous years.
In response, Xu Yang, chairman of Shanghai-based Makorong Information Consulting Co., Ltd., said the overall valuation of A-shares was low this year. Buying back shares at a relatively low price would help listed companies to use their funds more efficiently, reflecting their willingness to actively manage their market capitalization and their abundant cash flow, and would help boost investor confidence.
In addition, the continuous improvement of the share repurchase system, also promoted listed companies to actively carry out share repurchase.
Earlier this year, for example, the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges issued detailed rules for listed companies to buy back shares, providing detailed rules and guidelines for listed companies to do so.
Moreover, according to media statistics, since this year, listed companies that have implemented plans to increase their holdings have been concentrated in infrastructure, real estate, information technology and electronics manufacturing.
In addition, from the amount of repurchase payments, this year six listed companies repurchase more than 1 billion yuan.
Among them, the first is Erie shares, its repurchase of more than 5 billion yuan.
What will the repurchase of stocks by listed companies have on the market?
Zhao Xijun, vice-dean of the School of Finance and Finance at Renmin University of China, told China News Agency reporters that buybacks on the one hand show that the listed companies have stronger economic strength and better financial situation, the ability to maintain stock price stability and give investors confidence; on the other hand, they also show that the listed companies and their controlling shareholders are responsible to the company, to the market and to investors.
The former is based on the company's good performance, while the latter requires the listed company and its controlling shareholders to have higher quality.
For capital markets, these are the most core of the fundamentals.
Repurchase of stocks by listed companies is conducive to boosting investor confidence and supporting stock prices of listed companies.
According to the Oriental Securities Research Report, according to the total number of A-share listed companies since the beginning of this year's estimated stock repurchase, as well as the transaction average price of the repurchased shares, this year's repurchase of the A-share market is expected to bring additional funds of more than 150 billion yuan.
It took nearly two months for the restoration of the large-scale mural of Tianjin's Empress Dowager Temple, a key state cultural and cultural protection unit, to be reopened to the public on the 26th of this year's National Day.
The Holy Grail of the Queen of Heaven is a large traditional mural that reflects the life of Mazu in a comprehensive way.
Approved by the relevant state departments, it was painted by Cai Changkui, curator of Tianjin Folklore Museum (Tianhou Palace) from 1991 to 1994.
It is understood that the mural was painted on the southern and northern walls of the main hall of the Empress Dowager, which is 32 meters long and 2.6 meters high.
In recent years, Tianjin has had rainy summers and dry winters, which caused the murals to crack, accounting for 60 per cent of the area, Cai said.
In order to protect and rescue the murals of Ma Zu's deeds, the Ancient Culture Street Management Committee of Nankai District of Tianjin City and the Tianhou Palace initiated the restoration of the Tianhou Palace and the murals inside the palace.
The restoration project was led by Cai Changkui, who invited four famous Chinese painters to participate.
The restoration work is based on the principle of "old as usual," but also the original murals have made some adjustments to the contents of the original murals to complement the original imperfect repair.
In the restoration, we also in color, materials, ink and other innovations and experiments.
After the restoration, the original frescoes were preserved in their style, spirit, spirit and art.
Built in 1326, Tianfu Palace, formerly known as Tianfei Palace, is the oldest building complex in Tianjin, and one of the earliest extant Mazu Temples in China.
September 25, Beijing Daxing International Airport launch ceremony held.
The shape of Beijing Daxing International Airport terminal symbolizes "Phoenix Spreading Wings," and has been hailed as the first of the "seven wonders of the new world."
Beijing Capital International Airport is now overloaded, carrying more than 100 million passengers last year, making it the world's second airport to handle more than 100 million passengers a year, after Atlanta.
By 2022, Beijing Daxing International Airport is expected to handle 45 million passengers, or 20 per cent of international flights, and by 2025, 72 million passengers, or 30 per cent of international flights.
How cool is it as the "New Gate"?
Beijing Daxing International Airport is located between Daxing District of Beijing and Guangyang District of Langfang City, Hebei Province.
The steel roof of the station building has a projected surface area of 180,000 square metres and is the size of 25 standard football fields.
Beijing Daxing International Airport is the world's first terminal with two arrival and two departure levels - F1-F4 for international arrivals, domestic arrivals, domestic departures and international departures.
The two-storey bridge connecting the airport with the high-speed railway outside the terminal corresponds to the F3 and F4 international departures, respectively.
Beijing Daxing International Airport's first flight opened the era of Beijing's "Two Airports."
To date, 66 airlines have expressed interest in joining Daxing International Airport, including 20 domestic airlines, 46 Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan airlines and foreign airlines.
In the 2019 winter and spring season, Beijing Daxing International Airport is expected to open 116 flights, 101 domestic and 15 international, covering 112 destinations worldwide, including 97 domestic and 15 international.
This forms a "double hub" airport with coordinated development, moderate competition and first-class international competitiveness with Beijing Capital International Airport, which can not only alleviate the running pressure of the capacity saturation of the capital airport, but also better meet the urgent need of the rapid growth of air transportation in Beijing and surrounding areas, and effectively enhance the international competitiveness of China's civil aviation industry.
In order to ensure efficiency and quality, Beijing Daxing International Airport takes full account of its geographical location, its relationship with the surrounding airspace and operating environment. For the first time in China, the airport's runway has adopted a "one-way" layout, the world's largest automated air traffic control system has been adopted and China's largest terminal control area has been established, which will maximize the efficiency of aviation operations.
For the first time, domestic airports of this size have adopted a domestic baggage automation and information management system, adopted an innovative baggage transfer mode, and improved the efficiency of baggage handling system.
Beijing Daxing International Airport, the first flight, foreshadowed the Phoenix display wings dazzling cool takeoff.
The new airport, which has created more than 40 international and domestic airports, and has achieved a nationalization rate of more than 98 per cent, will surely have direct and indirect economic impact on the industries in the surrounding areas and inject vitality into Beijing's economic development.

Wang Boxiang, secretary of Shandong original Shouguang county committee - Qiang County Fumin Chizixin - Xinhua.com
Wang Boxiang, a Shandong Shouguang native, was born in February 1943 and joined the work force in 1967.
In 1986, Wang Boxiang was appointed secretary of Shouguang county committee in Shandong Province, which was then the poor county of Weifang.
During his five-year tenure, Wang Boxiang concentrated his efforts on three things: Promoting the industrialization of vegetables; developing Shoubei Salt-Alkali Beach; and laying the foundation for industrial rejuvenation.
Shouguang farmers have a tradition of growing vegetables and have learned the lessons of growing vegetables.
In the early 1980s, Shouguang farmers had a good harvest of vegetables but could not sell them, leaving them rotting on the ground.
Wang Boxiang found that the key to grasping vegetables is to make good circulation.
Shouguang pioneered the establishment of vegetable wholesale market, opened the development of the market economy prelude.
Party cadres should take the lead, screwed up, all losses in the county burden.
In 1989, with the support of Wang Boxiang, 17 Party members, including Wang Leyi of Sanyuan Zhucun, set up 17 winter-warm vegetable sheds.
Subsequently, the county set up a promotional team, under the mobilization of Wang Boxiang, Wang Leyi in various towns and villages tour guide; the first year to promote more than 5,000 vegetable sheds, after the vegetable sheds such as the momentum of the county and the whole country.
For thousands of years, Shoubei 1.6 million acres of land in addition to salt and alkaline beaches, is a shallow beach.
The local people live in great hardship.
Shou Nan has vegetable shed, Shou Bei how to do?
Wang Boxiang organized hundreds of thousands of people to fight a general assembly, camped on the desolate alkaline beach, a dry forty or fifty days.
Wang Boxiang and the leading cadres in the county ate and slept on the site, pushing carts and carrying loads like the migrant workers, eating and sleeping outdoors, and the people saw them thumbs up and admired them in their hearts...
In July 1986, Wang participated in the Weifang Industrial Conference for the first time as secretary of the county committee.
During the meeting, a "Comparison table of industrial economic figures in twelve counties of Weifang City" was distributed. At first glance, the total industrial output value of Shouguang was not bad, ranking fourth.
But if the original salt is taken away, Shouguang's net industrial output value is only 119 million yuan, the third lowest.
Wang Boxiang with more than 70 people's Bible reading group, to the field "for a change of mind."
Within a year, the county invested 150 million yuan in 77 projects.
Every year thereafter, "conversation groups" were organized to study in Shenzhen, Dongguan and Shanghai.
Shouguang is short of enterprises, and even short of entrepreneurs.
Wang Boxiang chaired a special meeting: In the county's open selection of factory director managers, 40 "business-minded talents" out, pushed into the industry.
In 1991, Shouguang entered the ranks of the country's top 100 counties, Wang Boxiang transferred to Weifang City Deputy Mayor.
He left behind more than 200,000 vegetable tents, 1.2 million mu of cotton fields, salt fields and shrimp ponds, 4,854 enterprises, more than 100,000 "ten thousand yuan households" and a cadre corps recognized by the people.
On September 26, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi presided over a meeting of the Foreign Ministers of China and African members of the Security Council at United Nations Headquarters in New York.
The meeting was attended by the Foreign Ministers of Côte d'Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, Equatorial Guinea and South Africa, as well as by the incoming Foreign Ministers of the Niger and Tunisia.
Wang Yi made four suggestions on strengthening cooperation between China and Africa in the Security Council.
First, we must unite our strength.
The greatest challenge in the current international situation is unilateralism. As a direct consequence, the basic norms of international relations are being challenged and the role of the United Nations is being undermined to the detriment of the interests of developing countries and small and medium-sized countries, including African countries.
To meet this challenge, Central Africa needs to work hand in hand, shoulder in shoulder, for unity to be strengthened.
In the Council, the three African countries speak with one voice, focusing not just on three votes, but on the continent as a whole.
China and Africa stand side by side, not just with four votes, but with other countries following, influencing and shaping the Council's agenda.
Since 2018, China has established the "3 + 1" coordination mechanism with African members of the Security Council.
Second, settle disputes by negotiation.
China has always advocated political settlement of hotspot issues.Africa has a good tradition of consultation and has also had the experience of successful mediation by African regional and subregional organizations.
Many of the complex problems on the Council's agenda, particularly the hotspots in Africa, are mostly rooted in the scourge of colonialism or are directly related to external factors.
Together, we should make good use of Chapter VI of the Charter of the United Nations and play the role of the United Nations in good offices and mediation.
Third, self - reliance for self - strengthening.
African countries and peoples know Africa's problems best, and Africa has the capacity and wisdom to solve its own problems.
In addressing hotspot issues in Africa, the Council should focus on listening to and respecting the will of Africa, should play the role of regional and subregional organizations and should encourage and support endogenous solutions from Africa.
China is ready to strengthen coordination with Africa and resolutely promote capacity-building for African-owned peace operations.
Fourth, development is fundamental.
Both China and the vast majority of African countries are developing countries.We must put economic and social development first and mutually support each other in their chosen development paths.
China is ready to closely link the "one belt, one road" initiative with the African Union's Agenda 2063, the United Nations Sustainable Development Agenda 2030 and the development strategies of African countries, so as to help African countries enhance their development capacity and eliminate the root causes of conflicts.
Together, we will push the United Nations to increase its investment in Africa's development.
In the wake of the outbreak of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, China has provided and will continue to provide full assistance, human and material resources to the best of its ability, and is ready to coordinate its efforts with African countries to mobilize the United Nations, WHO and other organizations to step up their assistance and give full play to the role of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

A maximum of three points for a free throw?
The NBA Development League (NBAD) announced a new rule for free throws on a trial basis, whereby the penalty is awarded only once and the score is determined by the foul.
O'Neill has a low free throw percentage among NBA stars.
The new rules allow two points for a two-point shot, three points for a three-point shot, and one point for a foul plus.
The last two minutes of regular time and extra time will follow the previous penalty kick rules.
Although the rule was only introduced on a trial basis in the NBA Development League, fans were more concerned about the impact it would have on current players if it were to be introduced in the NBA.
For now, many believe the new rules could be good for "bearded" Harden, while James, whose free throw was less impressive, would suffer.
Wuhan Promotes Intellectualization and Transformation of Industrial Enterprises to Grant Up to 20 Million Yuan Subsidy
Wuhan has accelerated its industrial intelligent transformation and implemented transformation subsidy measures of up to 20 million yuan since this year, reporters said at a series of conferences held by the Wuhan Municipal Government Information Office.
To date, has collected more than 800 scale industrial enterprises intelligent transformation needs information.
Zhang Hong, deputy director of Wuhan's Bureau of Economics and Informatization, said that this year, Wuhan launched an action plan for industrial enterprise intellectualization restructuring to provide free consulting and diagnosis services to industrial enterprises above the required scale and propose solutions to push forward a new round of technological restructuring of high-level enterprises.
According to the plan, each year Wuhan openly selects a group of specialized diagnostic service institutions to conduct a census of the intellectualized transformation needs of all industrial enterprises above the city's size by opening columns, conducting questionnaires and filling in reports at home.
To date, more than 800 industrial enterprises have been collected, accounting for nearly one-third of the city's industrial enterprises.
Five municipal diagnostic platforms have organized teams to be installed in enterprises in batches to conduct "one-on-one" on-site assessments and programme demonstrations.
Zhang Hong introduced that the city is currently organizing and implementing 373 intelligent transformation projects with a total planned investment of 29.76 billion yuan, including the first 5G intelligent production line in China, Motorola's leading intelligent mobile phone production line, Wuhan Siemens transformer digital unmanned factory, the first wholesale satellite production line in China, Huisheng Biology World's leading new veterinary medicine intelligent production line, and Europe's smart home Internet of Things intelligent production line.
In addition, Wuhan has also increased financial support for intellectualized transformation projects.
Among them, industrial enterprises undergoing intellectualized transformation will receive investments commensurate with their actual completion; investments in equipment and hardware, as well as soft investments in research and development, will receive transformation subsidies of 8 per cent and up to 20 million yuan.
At the same time, financial institutions such as China National Exchange and Zhejiang Commercial Bank Wuhan Branch have been actively united to provide personalized financial services specifically aimed at the intellectualization of industrial enterprises, thus greatly easing the pressure on enterprises to finance.
Trudeau collapsed. Can he be re-elected
This time, Trudeau tripped out of the "Great Pit", it was Trudeau himself dug a little bit.
Recently, the Canadian media has been repeatedly exposed in the incumbent Prime Minister Trudeau, the photos of Trudeau disguised as a black image.
This was regarded as a clear act of racial discrimination and prompted an uproar in Canada.
After the incident, Trudeau repeatedly apologized to the public.
Canadians, however, do not buy much.
Trudeau lifted the stone and threw it on his feet.
As political commentators such as Riley have pointed out, since the rise of the "anti-black face movement" in the United States, Trudeau and the Federal Liberal Party have been high-profile critics of the opposition or dissidents within their own party for their "disgraceful conduct" in this regard, and have repeatedly threatened that "whoever commits such a mistake should be summarily dismissed."
In a nutshell, it was Trudeau himself who dug the "big hole" that tripled him up this time.
Trudeau, the son of former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, was a young and handsome man who had a whirlwind of "political icons" in his early career.
Originally a "politician," he took over as leader of the FLP and fought an unexpectedly good fight in the 2015 federal legislative elections in which the FLP won a majority of seats in the House of Commons and gained valuable powers to form a separate government.
At the time, Trudeau proposed many deafening platforms and ideas, such as "ethnic and gender equality," "ecological protection," "economic revitalization," and emphasized the elimination of corruption and "corruption."
For five years, however, he has been "walking high and low" on almost all of these fronts.
In the case of "ethnic and gender equality," let alone the "black face," he had been "cheating" on a range of Aboriginal issues, leading Aboriginal groups and leaders to move protest tents to the Capitol Hill gates on the 150th anniversary of Canada's founding.
In the fight against corruption, Trudeau was embroiled in the roaring Lan Wan Ling affair late last year and early this year.
He was exposed, his hometown construction and engineering company "Lan Wanling" major irregularities and favouritism cases, to investigate and punish departments and officials to pressure the latter "high-handed."
Moreover, Trudeau became angry with the disclosure officer - Chaudi Wang, who was the first Canadian Attorney General to disclose a fraudulent case.
Although the case itself is still suspicious, its suspicions are difficult to wash away.
Many observers have pointed out that the collapse of Trudeau's five-year rule was largely the result of his own "digging holes," the largest of which were "tiger-headed, serpent-tailed," "self-eating," and "broader than the law, stricter than the law."
According to Canada's most authoritative Angus-Reid poll, respondents to Trudeau's party have slipped from more than 60% to more than 30% since 2015, while opponents have soared from less than 30% to more than 60%.
Despite similarly poor performances by the other opposition parties and their leader, even a significant proportion of those still voting for the Federal Liberal Party are now dismissive of the Federal Chancellor, the leader of the ruling party.
On October 21, as Canada's new federal legislative elections begin, will Trudeau be able to repeat the dramatic triumphs of five years ago?
The answer may be one word: Difficult.
Whether from the level of enterprise competition, consumer experience, regional aviation integration, Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei development integration, have far-reaching impact and positive significance.
On September 25, Beijing Daxing International Airport was officially opened.
Beijing's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) has been informed that the capital airport has been in an oversaturated operational state, the opening of Daxing International Airport will enhance the capacity of the capital aviation services.
Following Shanghai, Beijing became the second city in China to have two airports in the same city, similar to Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport, which mainly serves domestic aviation services, and Pudong Airport, which mainly serves international airlines.
Daxing Airport traffic, from the point of view of business development, for the capital airport is more positive impact.
In 2018, the airport's passenger throughput exceeded 100 million passengers, making it the largest in the country, but there is still a significant shortfall in capacity compared to the fast-growing demand, especially for international flights.
In order to better serve the needs of domestic and foreign passengers for tourism, business trips and other purposes, and in line with Beijing's increasingly open and internationally connected urban development, Daxing International Airport is positioned as a major international hub, with a planned annual passenger throughput of 100 million and freight and mail throughput of 4 million tons.
Therefore, the two airports do not overlap positioning, respectively for different customer groups, also have sufficient market space.
From an economic point of view, the opening of Daxing International Airport will obviously have a win-win effect, easing Beijing's air capacity constraints, speeding up the growth of passenger and cargo throughput, and creating an incremental cake of dual-core Beijing Airlines operations.
From the user's point of view, with the opening of Daxing International Airport, it is not necessary to concentrate on the capital airport in the future, but it can also reduce the number of problems caused by over-centralized routes, such as longer guaranteed stopover times, slower passenger boarding speeds, indirectly increasing aircraft and passenger stays at the airport, increasing the burden of airport operations, reducing the load through the capital airport, and in fact improving the travel experience of passengers.
According to media estimates of the time and cost of various transportation routes to major international airports, for example, from the southern fifth ring to the Beijing-Kai Expressway directly to Daxing Airport, which can be reached in 50 minutes by car, the fuel cost is around 40 yuan and the high-speed fare is 15 yuan; for the Daxing Airport Line of the rail transit subway, the distance is limited to 20 km and 30 km depending on the distance, and fares are divided into 10 yuan, 25 yuan and 35 yuan.
In general, the public to Daxing Airport has a variety of transportation options, the cost and time within a reasonable range.
From the point of view of trend development, Daxing Airport is located at the junction of Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei, so it is a bit far from Beijing, but it enhances the radiation to Hebei and Tianjin, facilitates more people to travel, and is of great significance to the economic development of Hebei and Tianjin.
In the future, passengers from Hebei and Tianjin can enjoy more international airline services provided by Daxing International Airport, as can be seen from the traffic planning of Daxing Airport.
In addition to the new airport line in Beijing, there are several highways connecting Daxing Airport with the surrounding area.
Just as passengers from Dongguan, Foshan, Qingyuan and other cities in Guangdong can travel to Guangzhou Baiyun Airport via the Guangzhou-Foshan and Guangzhou-Shenzhen highways, residents of Langfang and Xiong'an neighbourhoods around Beijing will also benefit from Daxing Airport for convenient and efficient air services.
From this, it can be seen that Daxing International Airport has not only increased the number of runways and aircraft, but has also had a profound impact and positive significance, not only in terms of competition among enterprises, consumer experience, but also in terms of regional aviation integration and the development of Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei, not only in terms of the long-term layout and development of Beijing's shipping industry, but also in terms of providing diversified choices for the travel of the vast majority of residents of Beijing and Tianjin and Hebei, promoting the further improvement of the quality of Beijing's shipping services, more conducive to promoting the process of integrated development of Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei and stimulating the economic and trade development of the area around Daxing Airport.
Therefore, for Daxing airport traffic, we not only need to calculate individual small accounts, but also the overall development of the big accounts.

2019 Vietnam Economic and Social Forum in Thanh Hóa Province
Vietnam's economic and social development showed many new improvements at the beginning of this year and continued to grow, according to Deputy Chairman of the National Assembly's Economic Committee, Nguyen Tan Dung.
The Forum focused on the economic and social issues highlighted in the first months of 2019 and proposed measures for economic and social development towards the end of 2019 and 2020.
At the Forum, participants exchanged in-depth views and opinions on four topics, namely, economic development in 2019 and the impact of some FTAs, some salient issues in the economy of Viet Nam in 2019, salient issues in social and cultural aspects of Viet Nam in 2019, and forecasts and proposals for the economic and social development of Viet Nam in 2020.
There was general agreement that global economic growth had slowed and risks and challenges had increased in the first months of 2019.
Trade frictions among the major economies have further shrunk global trade and investment.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded that despite the uncertainty in the global economy, with 70 per cent of the world's economies experiencing stagnant growth, Viet Nam had achieved many encouraging results in terms of stable macroeconomic performance, effective control of inflation and an average consumer price index (CPI) growth of 2.64 per cent in the first half of 2019, the lowest in nearly three years.
GDP growth in the first half of 2019 was 6.76 per cent, down from 7.05 per cent a year earlier, but still relatively high compared to the same period in the 2011-2017 period.
Deng Deying, deputy director of the National Centre for Economic and Social Forecasting, said the Vietnamese economy would show high growth in 2019 against the backdrop of world economic turmoil.
It is expected that by 2020, Viet Nam's macroeconomic situation will remain basically stable, the implementation of the FTAs will contribute to trade development, economic restructuring and the improvement of the business environment will be further strengthened, and Viet Nam's external export activities will show a downward trend due to trade frictions.
Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen monitoring, forecasting and early warning mechanisms, proactively seek trade relief measures for Viet Nam's export commodities, seek opportunities to expand new export markets and facilitate the export of various commodities, such as agricultural and aquatic products.
At the same time, inflation should be kept at a reasonable level, thereby promoting the development of ancillary industries and supporting the development of high-tech, organic and ecological agriculture.
Liu Zhijie, Director of the Consular Office of the Chinese Embassy in Siem Reap, held a reception in Siem Reap to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of New China.
Liu said that in the 70 years since the founding of New China, China has actively participated in international affairs, contributed more Chinese wisdom and Chinese programmes to improve global economic governance and promote common global development, made important contributions to world peace and development, and brought tangible benefits to Cambodia's economic development and people's well-being.
As the world's second-largest economy, China's contribution to world economic growth exceeded 30 per cent, especially the "one belt, one road" initiative, and cooperation between China's local provinces and cities and Siem Reap and territorial provinces was deepening, Liu said.
He said this year marks the beginning of 61 years of diplomatic relations between China and Cambodia.The two countries enjoy fraternal friendship and mutually beneficial cooperation will be the driving force for economic and social development in the region.
Siem Reap Governor Di Sakha highly praised the great achievements of New China over the past 70 years and congratulated the two countries on the achievements of their friendly cooperation.
His delegation hoped that the two sides would continue to work together to promote Sino-Cambodian friendship and cooperation, strengthen mutual trust and mutual benefit, and constantly improve the living standards of their people.
He said that Siem Reap province has made remarkable friendly contacts with all provinces and cities of China.So far, friendly city relations have been concluded with 28 provinces and cities of China, large-scale cultural and performing arts projects such as "Smile of Angkor" and "Angkor Dynasty" have been launched, the Siem Reap-Guangdong Agricultural Demonstration Park, the Siem Reap New International Airport project, special training courses for officials of the Siem Reap provincial government, scholarships for students from Siem Reap to study in China, rural clinics, urban road rehabilitation and the public welfare project "Bright Walk" have borne fruit and the people of Siem Reap have become direct beneficiaries of the friendly cooperation between Cambodia and China.
The reception was attended by the State Secretary of the Ministry of Defence of Cambodia, Ken Manson; the Chairman of the Siem Reap Provincial Council, Ong Heng; the Governors of the five provinces of the territory; the Siem Reap Chapter of the Cambodian-Chinese Council; volunteer teachers; the Siem Reap Chapter of the Cambodian-Chinese Chamber of Commerce; representatives of Chinese-owned enterprises; and representatives of foreign consular missions in Siem Reap.
Witness Digital China's Ten-Year Rise in Yunqi Town - Xinhua News Agency
Taking the 2009 Local Web Forum as the starting point, the 2019 Cloud Habitat Conference, held in Hangzhou from 25 to 27 September, has been going on for a decade.
From the concept of "in the cloud" to the practice of "in the cloud," big data and cloud computing have become one of the core technologies underpinning China's economic development, social management and public services over the past decade.
At Zhengtai New Energy Photovoltaic Plant in Haining, Zhejiang Province, inspectors were recently joined by new "collaborators" loaded with Ali Yun's artificial intelligence.
It operates 24 hours a day, recognizes more than twice as fast as manually, and has a stable quality control accuracy of more than 95%.
The camera-equipped "quality inspector" has studied more than 40,000 defective samples and, thanks to the computing power behind it, can quickly convert infrared images into binary language and classify defective batteries, according to the company's director.
The company is just a microcosm of today's cloud computing-enabled manufacturing transformation.
In 2018, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology issued the "Guidelines for the Implementation of Cloud-enabled Enterprises (2018-2020)," which proposed that by 2020, efforts should be made to achieve a significant increase in enterprises' awareness and enthusiasm for cloud-enabled enterprises, as well as a significant increase in the proportion and depth of cloud-enabled applications.
Today, data-centric cloud computing has opened the way for a digital economy in which data is a key element, says Wang Jian, founder of Ali Cloud.
Meanwhile, the scale of cloud computing industry in China has been expanding in the past 10 years.
According to the White Paper on Cloud Computing Development 2019, released by the China Institute of Information and Communications Technology in July, the overall market size of cloud computing in China reached 96.28 billion yuan in 2018, an increase of 39.2% over 2017.
In addition to being the key technology underpinning industrial transformation and digital economic development, the invisible "cloud" has unwittingly transformed urban governance and social life.
At this year's conference, the "urban brain," which has been unveiled for three years in a row, still attracts attention.
At present, the urban brain has been transformed from a transportation governance tool into an urban management hub, and its cooperative applications have been extended to 23 cities around the world, Mr. Ali said.
Through camera perception, artificial intelligence algorithms, and the city brain's powerful computational capabilities, new urban management services such as "park first, pay later," "real-time perception of the number of visits," and "tour route design" are being implemented.
In the area of government services, cloud computing has facilitated the provision of government services at both ends of the spectrum by connecting "one thing" with "one cloud" to promote "hands-on" and "hands-on" cooperation.
At present, Zhejiang has constructed a unified public data platform through government administration.
As of September 11, the platform has covered more than 57 million inhabitants of the province and more than 15 million legal entities, collecting 190.8 billion data in 3066 categories.
With an average of 12 million monthly data calls and sharings between government departments in Zhejiang Province, each more data call flow on the cloud could mean fewer errands for the masses.
Be careful to use plastic tea bags to make tea!
A packet of plastic tea bags could release billions or even tens of billions of microscopic plastic particles, significantly higher than one person's estimated annual intake of microscopic plastics, a new Canadian study has found, but so far there is no evidence that the intake of microscopic plastic particles poses a threat to humans, China Central News reported.
Researchers at the University of Magill in Canada reportedly found that dipping plastic tea bags into a glass of almost boiling hot water (95 ° C) released about 11.6 billion plastic particles and 3.1 billion smaller nanoparticles into the cup.
This amount is significantly higher than one person's estimated annual intake of microplastics.
According to a study published earlier in 2019, the average person eats at least 50,000 plastic particles a year and inhales the same amount of microplastics.
The study, published in the Journal of Environmental Science and Technology, found that the researchers tested four different types of plastic commercial tea bags in Montreal shops and cafes, opened them, washed them, immersed them in almost boiling water for five minutes and analyzed them with an electronic microscope and a spectrometer.
According to the study, they found that a single tea bag released more than 11.6 billion plastic particles, "several orders of magnitude higher than the previous plastic load on other foods."
Most bags are made of natural fiber, but many brands that make bags from natural fiber still use plastic to seal them, the report said.
Some brands have switched from paper-based bags to plastics, and these are the ones being tested.
Plastic particles are tiny pieces of plastic, defined by researchers as being between 100 nanometres and 5 millimetres in size, produced mainly by the breakdown of plastic waste.
Researchers have found traces of plastic particles in air, soil, rivers and the deepest ocean trenches around the world, as well as in tap water, bottled water, seafood and beer.
Plastic particles were first detected in human excreta samples from several countries in different regions of the world in October 2018.
To test the potential toxicity of tea bags releasing plastic particles, the Canadian team placed fleas in contaminated water and found that the microplastics affected the fleas' behavior and deformed them.
According to the World Health Organization, there is no evidence to date that ingestion of plastic particles poses a threat to humans.
However, the WHO notes that more research is needed to fully understand how these plastics spread to the environment and what impacts they have on humans.
The researchers speculate that the bags may have released large amounts of plastic particles when they came in contact with boiling water, and that even when "food grade" plastics were heated above 40 degrees Celsius, they could break down or seep toxic substances.
According to Guterres, climate emergencies are the greatest threat to the survival of small island States.
There, a natural disaster can erode the development gains of a generation.
This is illustrated by the hurricanes that have struck Papua, the Dominican Republic and the Bahamas this year.
Approximately one quarter of the population of small island developing States lives at an altitude of 5 metres or less.
Relocation can seriously affect their society and way of life and even raise issues of sovereignty and national identity.
At the Climate Action Summit on Monday, small island nations once again took the world in the right direction by committing to achieving a carbon-neutral and 100% renewable energy base by 2030.
"The climate crisis is piling new injustices on top of old ones," Guterres said.
Although small island developing States contributed little to global warming, they paid the highest price.
Because of their middle-income status, many countries are also caught in an accelerating and unsustainable cycle of disasters and debt.
The world must act, and the time has come to make major decisions and invest heavily in small island developing States. "
Today's high-level meeting adopted a political declaration calling for ways to seek assistance to small island developing States in managing disaster risks, investing in climate-resilient infrastructure and transitioning to renewable energy; and urging international institutions to help small island developing States, particularly heavily indebted middle-income countries, to access financing.
Small island developing States are at the forefront of protecting and conserving the Earth's lifeline, the oceans.
The latest special report issued this week by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change confirms that the oceans and seas have already suffered the severe "engulfing" consequences of the climate crisis.
By mid-century, extreme sea-level rise, which would have occurred only once a century, is likely to occur every year in many regions.
The report warns that without significant investment in adaptation, some island countries are likely to become uninhabitable.
Pollution, overfishing and acidification have caused enormous losses.
Over the past 150 years, the world has lost half of all living corals, while plastic pollution has increased tenfold over the past 40 years.
The demands of industry, shipping, mining and tourism are leading to a reduction in resources, including the maintenance of fisheries in many island communities.
Small island States also face high costs of transport, energy and infrastructure.
They are heavily dependent on some external markets and are subject to price fluctuations.
Some States are also working to address the security implications of illicit trafficking in persons, arms and drugs.
"By tackling a problem in one of the most challenging environments, it can be solved anywhere," Guterres said.
The efforts of small island developing States to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development will provide us with tools, lessons learned and examples that the world can learn from. "
He emphasized that small island developing States were a special case for sustainable development.
They require the long-term attention and investment of the entire international community.
India's finance ministry says the financial system is fully liquid.
India's economy is expected to pick up in the second half of the fiscal year, driven by holiday consumption demand as the financial system remains liquid, Finance Minister Manmohan Sitaraman said on Tuesday.
Mr. Sitaraman's comments came after meetings with representatives of India's private banks, non-bank financial institutions and housing banks.
Mr. Sitaraman did not specify the purpose of the statements.
Some Indian and overseas media outlets had previously blamed liquidity constraints on non-bank financial institutions for India's ongoing economic slowdown.
Citing the decline in car sales as an example, Mr. Seetharaman dismissed liquidity constraints as the main cause of the decline.
The decline in auto sales is largely driven by cyclical factors, notes Mr. Sitaraman.
India's economy is likely to pick up in the second half of the fiscal year, driven by holiday spending, Mr.
India's annual shopping season begins in September and lasts until the end of the year.
The market expects that shopping consumption will contribute significantly to India's economic growth.
Jiangxi Education Department recently issued a notice banning all primary and secondary schools in the province during the National Day holiday irregular remedial classes, and will organize random inspection and secret visits.
In the Circular on the Strict Prohibition of Irregularities in Complementing Classes on National Day, the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Education emphasized that all primary and secondary schools in all regions should resolutely ensure that, during the National Day period, they do not organize students to take collective supplementary classes or new classes, do not organize courses in disciplines, specialty classes, Olympiad classes, interest classes, enhancement classes, etc., and do not rent their campuses or school buildings to other educational institutions for various types of training courses.
At the same time, it is strictly prohibited for serving primary and secondary school teachers to organize, recommend and induce students to attend irregular remedial classes inside or outside the school, for serving primary and secondary school teachers to attend irregular remedial classes in out-of-school training institutions or organized by other teachers, parents, parents' committees, etc., and for serving primary and secondary school teachers to introduce students and provide relevant information to out-of-school training institutions and others.
It is clear from the circular that, in the event of violations of the provision of remedial classes by primary and secondary schools, the education administration departments of the localities in which such violations are found to have occurred will increase the deduction of points in the assessment of the quality development of education by the county-level governments that year, and that teachers who participate in such violations will be dealt with seriously in accordance with the relevant provisions on teachers' ethics.
Enabling pig production to secure market supply
Sui's Loyalty Requires the Implementation of Measures in Six Aspects
A teleconference was held today to mobilize and redeploy the efforts of the central, provincial and provincial governments to implement policies and measures to support pig production and ensure market supply.
Sui loyalty demands, from six aspects to catch good pig production measures to implement.
To grasp the "basket of vegetables" mayors responsible for the implementation of this year's province-wide clear 45 million pigs column tasks have been broken down into municipalities and counties, into the accountability system.
We should grasp the implementation of all policies and measures and effectively solve the problem of the "last mile" of policy implementation.
We will improve the production of breeding mother pigs, conscientiously implement the policy of subsidizing the production of good breeding mother pigs, encourage pig breeding enterprises to expand the breeding scale of pigs, and select quality sows from the commercial pig population in a planned manner.
We should take the well-known domestic large-scale aquaculture enterprises that have not yet entered our province as the top priority in attracting investment.
Grasp the implementation of the market circulation system, accelerate the construction of cold-chain logistics facilities for pig production, and comprehensively promote the transition from "pork-mixing" to "pork-mixing."
The modern epidemic prevention system should be well implemented.All localities should have basic-level epidemic prevention and quarantine personnel commensurate with the scale of farming and the tasks to be performed, and the first line of epidemic prevention and control should be firmly established.
Sui loyalty demands, fully guarantees the meat market supply, ensures that there is no large-scale shortage, large-scale disruption of supply, ensures the major holiday pork market supply stability.
The meeting also deployed work on the prevention and control of African swine plague, the prohibition and withdrawal of catches in important waters of the Yangtze River Basin and the purchase of mid-late rice throughout the province.
Speaking of the feelings of the motherland, national soul White Rabbit and other representatives of the old Shanghai characters attended party classes for university students
"I and my motherland" campus punch points to let the university students "revel in Shu".
On the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, Shanghai Soap Making, Shao Wansheng, White Rabbit and the four rarely-known Shanghai Old Character Groups gathered at East China Polytechnic University on the 27th for the "Arts Party Class," where four representatives of Shanghai Old Character Groups, with an average history of more than 90 years, spoke to more than 200 young students about the motherland and the national soul of the brands.
The exhibition shows the products of the old brands on the spot.
Students were amazed by the loveliness of the lectures. Outside the classroom, there were elaborate displays of the products of the old brands, as well as "I and my motherland" campus cards to make students "happy."

Shinzo Abe recorded a video celebrating the 70th anniversary of the founding of New China and said a Chinese sentence
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe congratulated the People's Republic of China on the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe: Good evening, everyone. I'm Shinzo Abe.
On behalf of the Government and people of Japan, I would like to extend warm congratulations on the occasion of the seventieth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
At the G20 summit held in Osaka in June, Japan and China worked together to make the summit a success and adopted the Osaka Declaration of G20 Leaders, which proclaimed the firm will of the G20 to the world.
Moreover, at the pre-summit Japanese-Chinese summit and dinner, it was agreed that President Xi Jinping would pay a state visit to Japan next spring, and that the two sides were united in their determination to usher in a new era for Japan and China.
Japan and China share a great responsibility for peace and prosperity in Asia and the world.
I firmly believe that the two countries' joint efforts to tackle the problems facing the region and the world and their joint contributions to the international community will contribute to building a new model of future relations between the two countries.
Finally, I wish Japan-China relations flourish and my friends prosperity in their careers.
Overage migrant workers on some sites are estimated to account for more than half.
Where can I find young workers now?
I don't want to use so many old people on the site. There's no way.
Recently, there are many over-age migrant workers on the site (over the retirement age) phenomenon, long-time construction contractor Zou Kui lamented.
Recently, the author's colleges and universities to carry out the rain pollution diversion project, the campus has a lot of migrant workers, if you pay attention to, will find that there are a lot of over-age migrant workers.
Over-age migrant workers are not "not idle," but because "not idle," with "have to do so" helplessness and hardship - whether to save money to solve their old-age and medical problems, or to help their children, drive these should "idle" older people to continue to work hard.
The elderly migrant worker's dependence is not as easy as we think.
Raising children, supporting the elderly, providing for children to study, helping children to build buildings and buy cars, helping children to establish a family and raise their grandchildren over the generations, when these migrant workers have accomplished their "life tasks," their pockets have been emptied and even many debts have been incurred, and most of them lack the means to accumulate wealth.
In order not to drag down their children and to save more for themselves, many migrant workers insist on "doing until they can't do it."
The reluctance of many new generations of "post-80," "post-90" and even "post-00" migrant workers to engage in arduous, labour-intensive secondary industries or low-end services has resulted in structural "labour shortages," which provide opportunities for over-age migrant workers in unattractive jobs.
Due to the lack of a skill, physical function and labor capacity have declined, many over-age migrant workers are working in high-intensity, low-income, high-risk and low-security jobs.
Being able to work day by day, earning more is a little bit, "can't idle" behind the survival predicament of over-aged migrant workers, cannot be ignored and ignored.
In addition to their "self-saving," over-age migrant workers cannot be separated from the institutional protection and humane care of the public sector in solving the problem of unpaid wages and salary claims, improving labour protection, reducing safety risks, increasing labour income and improving their living conditions.
Some scholars have pointed out that over-age migrant workers are less likely to rely on farming at home to cope with their old age and medical problems, and that they have to provide for their families in other ways.
To understand the helplessness and strength of over-aged migrant workers "can't be idle" helps us to better understand the love and pain of over-aged migrant workers.
Seeing the backs of over-aged migrant workers, hearing their sighs, and finding ways to make their return to the countryside a real "reliance on old age" require shared responsibility among the public sector, markets, and society in a virtuous interaction.
He said Russia would not export the system over the next five years because "it would first supply its own army and then export production."
This practice is fully consistent with international practice.
The major producers of arms and military equipment always ensure their own defence needs before processing export orders.
Earlier, the deputy commander-in-chief of the Russian space force, General Yuri Grekhov, said development of the system was nearing completion.
The S-500 system was developed by the "Diamond-Antey" airborne defence company Concen.
This is a new generation of air defence systems that employs principles for the destruction of ballistic and aerodynamic targets.
The main role of the S-500 is to intercept medium-range ballistic missiles, which can intercept missiles with a range of less than 3,500 km.
Additionally, according to some sources, the S-500 can destroy supersonic cruise missiles as well as aircraft, almost all types of unmanned aircraft, supersonic missiles more than five times the speed of sound, and even targets in near-space.
Such weapons can also be integrated into a unified network with other air defence systems, in particular the S-400 system, which is very important from a defence perspective.
Sergei Chemezov expressed particular concern about the S-400.
He said the system is in great demand around the world, but Russian troops also need it, including in the Arctic.
The S-400 anti-aircraft system entered service with the Arctic Air Defence Regiment.
According to information received on 15 September, the conversion of the S-400 anti-aircraft missile system of the Arctic Air Defence Regiment at Newlands Island has been completed.
This is not Russia's militarization of the Arctic.
According to the Russian Ministry of Defence, this is entirely within the framework of the plan for the transition to more advanced defensive instruments in the strategic direction of the north.
"With the transition to the new S-400 anti-aircraft system, controlled airspace in the Arctic region has grown significantly," the news agency of the Russian Northern Fleet said.
Significantly, the military has assessed that the system has been used successfully in the Arctic and Arctic regions.
The regiment's officers and men were trained in the new system and prepared for combat duty.
Previously equipped with the S-300 long-range air defence system, it is still partly preserved.
When it comes to air defence systems, they must have weapons capable of destroying a variety of aerial targets, be they high-speed targets at outer altitudes or "fish in a net" approaching protected installations.
According to open sources, the S-400 Triumph system, developed by Skydefense Concern, is designed to attack strategic and tactical aircraft, ballistic missiles, hypersonic targets and other aerial attack weapons.
This weapon can attack aerodynamic targets at a range of 400 km and shoot down ballistic targets flying at 4.8 km / s at a distance of 60 km.
Russia has never concealed that it will deploy additional air defence forces in the far north to secure its airspace along the northern sea route.
Not long ago, the first 12 Thor-M2DT anti-aircraft missile systems were delivered to Russia's Arctic region, sufficient to form an anti-aircraft battalion to reinforce the Arctic region's anti-aircraft systems.
The Russian Ministry of Defence said then that the Arctic "Tor" force would be expanded to full brigade size in the future.
Together with the new S-400 long-range system deployed on Novaya Zemlya and the Kola Peninsula and the Armored-SA short-range system deployed in the far north, these advanced anti-aircraft weapons provide a powerful defence of Russia's polar skies.
Enemy aircraft, helicopters, and drone missiles will be hard to break through.
According to the Russian government, the flagship store would be a platform for Russian manufacturers to place their goods, avoiding the complex and lengthy process of opening their own stores.
As the operator of Russian goods stores, Russian products multi-company focuses on selling Russian goods in China.
Many of China's largest trading platforms, including Tian猫, Jingdong (JD), 1688, JiaoDo, HandQ, and WeChat, have their own online platforms, including Epindoo.com and Russian merchandise retail chains.
The Russian Export Centre will work with Rosneft to develop store marketing strategies and participation criteria, and screen virtual shelving enterprises for products on shelves.
The store is scheduled to open by the end of the year and will display products from at least 10 Russian manufacturers.
According to the Russian Export Center, the total number of visits to China's e-commerce platforms is as high as 1 billion per month.
Meanwhile, food exports to China have been growing steadily since 2014, surpassing $1 billion in 2018.
At present, Alibaba Group will also open a pilot store within the framework of the global import strategy to sell goods from New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore.
According to Alexei Kozhevnikov, the new store will display goods from companies with sales of at least 500 million rubles.
To tell you the truth, my expectations are higher, 500 million roubles of sales are not enough.
We all know that Chinese consumers have a very positive attitude towards Russian goods, seeing them as high-quality and environmentally friendly products.
Mr. Kozhivnikov said the competition for Chinese consumers, who have a strong purchasing power, is fierce and growing.
"Our goal is to launch 500 businesses through this store within three years," he said.
At the same time, the platform will also be on the shelves of Russian Far East enterprises'products.
"It's a political project that represents the image of both sides, because Russia's export centres are state-owned, not private institutions," said Vyacheslav Cheglov, a professor in the Department of Trade Policy Fundamentals at the Plekhanov Economic University in Russia.
"I don't see a lot of competitive Russian goods on the market."
He believed that the project would probably not actually be implemented, but would help to strengthen relations between the two countries.
More than 170 Russian companies' products have been posted on Alibaba.com, the largest international wholesale online platform, and can be purchased in China and other countries, Andrei Slipnev, president of Russia's Export Centre, said during the Eastern Economic Forum, according to A Russian news agency.
There is also a model for cooperation with Alibaba Group, a training program for Russian enterprises by experts from Taobao University, the first of which was held in July.
The Russian Export Centre will also be the organizer of Russian enterprises' participation in industry exhibitions and business projects at the second China International Import Expo in Shanghai in November.
A large exhibition will be held in a 1,000-square-metre exhibition hall, which will also serve as a centre for business project activities, agreement signing ceremonies, presentations and meetings with Chinese business representatives.
Approximately 50 applications have been received from Russian agricultural enterprises.
"In addition to the agricultural stands, we will certainly hold business meetings, that is, arrange direct contacts between entrepreneurs," said the news agency of the Russian Export Centre.
"This is another direction of our efforts to support businesses and ensure that dozens of specialized meetings are arranged for them."
In addition, the fair will hold master classes, cooking competitions and the "Exploring the Shanghai Station of Russian Food" project of famous Russian chefs cooking Russian American food congresses.

On the other hand, Sheriff General Noachan said the police would wait for a full report on the content of the ruling before taking action.

Xinhua Time Review: Be firm in not moving our own way
China and the World in a New Era, a white paper released on the 27th of this year, answers: The success of China's development over the past 70 years is rooted in the fact that, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC), the Chinese people have found the right path of development with Chinese characteristics and have steadfastly followed it.
It is the choice of history and the choice of the people that China follows the path of development that suits it.
Since modern times, in an environment of poverty and weakness, internal and external worries, generations of benefactors and philanthropists have sought and continued to seek the way to save the country and its people.
However, "constitutional monarchy, restored monarchy, parliamentary system, multi-party system, presidential system all thought about, tried, the result is not workable."
Only with the Communist Party of China and the New China did the Chinese people gradually open up a path of socialism with Chinese characteristics in practice.
The road out of which China has embarked is the road to the happiness of the Chinese people, to the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation and to the common development of China with other countries in the world.
It is precisely because China is on the right path that it can do its job well, become the world's second-largest economy and contribute the most to global economic growth, and continue to benefit the world through its own development.
As pointed out in the White Paper, China's development path is in line with China's national conditions and meets the requirements of the times.
Looking back, the Chinese people know how difficult it is to find the right path. Looking around the world, the Chinese people cherish the right path even more.
The Chinese understand the reason of the northern orange, understand that what suits others may not suit oneself, only suits oneself is the best.
It is with this road-confidence and strategic determination that China has created a miracle that has captured the world's attention.
In the tortuous process of human advancement, the "end of history" has been famous for a while.
Today, the success of the socialist road with Chinese characteristics has proclaimed the end of the "end of history," the collapse of the "Chinese collapse doctrine" and the failure of the "socialist failure doctrine."
China's success has boosted the confidence of developing countries in achieving prosperity for their people and expanded their path towards modernization, providing experience and lessons for those countries and peoples in the world who wish to accelerate their development while maintaining their independence and follow a path consistent with their national conditions.
The world is rich and colorful.
China has always respected the right of all countries to choose a development path suited to their national conditions.
China will not "import" foreign models or "export" Chinese models. Instead, it will steadfastly follow its own path, achieve its own continuous development, strengthen governance and exchanges with other countries, and make its due contribution to the common realization of good governance.
The Fair Work Commission found that the boss of a Foodworks supermarket, who fired a 66-year-old worker by text message because he preferred to hire people from Asian backgrounds, was strongly criticized as "disgraceful."
The Commission stated that Ms. Gail Ayton's boss, Jianbin Wang (Eddie), who had worked at Wagga Wagga for more than 20 years, treated her employees in a manner that was "extremely unfair" and possibly in violation of anti-discrimination laws.
Ms. Ayton told the Committee that Mr. Wang had taken over the store in 2016 and that he had been "wanting to fire me" because she was not Chinese.
In this case, Peter Sams, Vice-Chairman of the Commission, conducted a search on the Internet and found that "Mr. Wang had posted some job advertisements in the past on various Chinese Australian employment forums."
Among the job requirements listed for these positions, one said "Woman of the Year" and the other "Employee of the Year."
The third post said that he was "more inclined to overseas people."
Mr. Wang dismissed Ms. Ayton by text message in April of this year, later claiming that it was due to her absence from work and the alleged lack of cash on the cash register ranging from $5.10 to $30.
However, Mr. Sams stated that Mr. Wang's reasons for dismissing Ms. Ayton were weak and unsubstantiated.
She had been absent from only one shift in three years, and the "missing amount" totalled several Australian dollars.
He stated that Ms. Ayton's dismissal "actually had nothing to do with her conduct or behaviour."
"It seems to me, backed up by evidence from Mr. Wang's advertisement, that the real motive for her dismissal was that he preferred to hire someone with an Asian background," he said.
Pursuant to section 772 (f) of the Fair Work Act, Mr. Wang's conduct, which appeared to constitute a violation of the anti-discrimination law and / or the dismissal of the applicant, was unlawful. "
Mr. Sams stated that, in view of Mr. Wang's "horrible" treatment of Ms. Ayton, it was inappropriate for him to consider reinstating her in her post.
He should consider paying compensation to Ms. Ayton, a casual worker with an hourly wage of $26.
In view of possible violations of anti-discrimination and labour relations legislation, Sams stated that he would submit his findings and documents to the Commission's authority to consider whether Mr. Wang's actions should be referred to other bodies to investigate possible violations of state or federal law.
He states that Mr. Wang did not give Ms. Ayton any opportunity to respond to the alleged reasons for her dismissal.
He said: "I believe that the respondent took an irremediably unfair and biased procedure to dismiss the applicant and that Mr. Wang" awaited "this opportunity, which he believed would 'justify' the termination of the applicant's employment."
"He was wrong... The respondent dismissed the applicant with total disregard for any natural justice accorded to her and, shockingly, for his rude and grossly unfair perfunctory behaviour."
Mr. Sams said that although Foodworks was a small business, "it must be frankly stated that no decent employer would dismiss an employee in the most unfair and perfunctory manner admitted in this case."
He said: "This is shameful and extremely unfair."

"Fox Hunt," a cross-border detective drama series, was recently filmed in Tianjin airport. Actors Wang Kai and Wang Qu filmed important scenes, such as transporting fugitive economic suspects back to their home countries, with support from China Southern Airlines.
This time, Fox crews filmed key scenes at the airport that best illustrate the results of Operation Fox, in which the team hunts for fugitives, seizes planes, signs arrest warrants, and so on.
The crew filmed a number of scenes on the tarmac, customs border checkpoints, and the passenger cabin and doors of the aircraft, re-presenting China's first-line detective police and fox-hunting heroes flying in many countries, hunting for fugitives and the hard journey and professional style.
To complete the shoot successfully, Fox's creators undertook extensive pre-production work, reconfirming every execution detail to ensure the most realistic and compelling visuals.
It is believed that the show will also be filmed in a number of foreign locations.
Vietnam should seize the opportunity of AI development.
The four criteria used to assess and rank cities' readiness to face the AI wave include prospects, realization capabilities, asset base, and direction of development.
Singapore ranked first, followed by cities in the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany and Australia.
Speaking to reporters, Oliver Wyman said: "I find it very interesting to review and evaluate cities such as Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam.
Overall, I think Vietnam's future is bright against the backdrop of high growth, a strong economic development path and a fast-growing talent base.
I think Viet Nam is on the right track and doing well.
It is important for Viet Nam to know how to take advantage of the opportunities presented by the Fourth Industrial Revolution to further its economic development.
Artificial intelligence is revolutionizing the way people work, communicate and live.
It brings greater efficiency, but also threatens to exacerbate social, economic and technological inequalities.
Yet, according to a global study by Oliver Wyman, the only cities in the world today are ready for the breakthroughs of the AI age.

China faces a severe pork shortage following the outbreak of swine fever in Africa and is expected to become Australia's largest beef export market, according to an animal protein analyst at the Dutch cooperative bank.
Chinese consumers are switching from pork to other animal proteins in the aftermath of the outbreak, which has led authorities to destroy large herds of livestock. In the past year, China's pig population has been halved and pork prices have almost doubled.
China produces and consumes two-thirds of the world's pork.
Demand for other meats, including beef, has increased, with China, the world's largest importer of animal protein, now importing 27 per cent of the world's pork and 24 per cent of the world's beef, said Chenjun Pan, senior animal protein analyst for China at Dutch cooperative bank ABN Amro.

Repurchase of listed companies exceeded 100 billion yuan in year - Xinhua News Agency
In order to stabilize the company's share price and preserve its image, listed companies have begun to repurchase shares frequently in the past two years, hoping to relay to the market the information that the company's value is undervalued through targeted repurchase and collective bidding, thus stabilizing the share price and enhancing investor confidence.
According to Eastern Wealth Choice, the amount of funds used by listed companies to buy back shares in 2017 was 7.9 billion yuan, which jumped to 51 billion yuan in 2018, and since 2019, the total amount of A-share repurchases implemented by listed companies has exceeded 100 billion yuan, the highest amount of A-share repurchase funds in history and far more than in previous years.
From the point of view of the purpose of repurchase, the repurchase of shares appears to be the same as the increase of shareholders, but there are great differences among the implementing entity, the source of funds, the purpose of repurchase and the equity of the shares themselves.
Xu Yang, chairman of Shanghai Maikerong Information Consulting Co., Ltd., told Securities Daily reporters that the November 2018 Opinions on Supporting Share Repurchase by Listed Companies had been issued to rectify existing problems such as the narrow scope of share repurchase, complicated decision-making procedures and unsound inventory system.
In January this year, the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges officially issued the Implementation Rules for Share Repurchase by Listed Companies.These policies broadened the sources of funds for share repurchase by listed companies, properly simplified implementation procedures, guided the improvement of governance arrangements, and encouraged various listed companies to implement incentives for equity ownership or employee ownership plans.
Subsequent to the opinion, listed companies to share repurchase operations, with more applicable circumstances, the repurchase process is simpler, share repurchase enthusiasm is also more.
Repurchase of shares at a relatively low position also helps listed companies to use their funds more efficiently, thus increasing earnings per share, raising net asset returns and reducing the pressure on corporate earnings indicators.
Compared with the increase of shareholders, the repurchase of shares by listed companies is more meaningful and reflects the willingness of listed companies to actively manage their market capitalization and abundant cash flow.
Xu Yang believes that the undervalued share price is the main factor of the listed company's repurchase, the company's share price already cannot reflect the company's future development prospects, so such companies deserve the attention of investors, but not blindly to invest, the need to pay attention to the financial statements of such listed companies and the specific operations.
The large-scale repurchase of listed companies, at least indicated the company's development confidence and financial strength.
Increasing enthusiasm for A-share repurchase by listed companies has also normalized repurchase activity, with data showing that nearly 1,000 listed companies have implemented share repurchase this year, and leading companies in various industries have become the mainstay of the repurchase market.
Ping An of China recently disclosed the progress of the repurchase, saying the company has accumulated 57.59 million A-shares, or 0.315 per cent of the company's total equity, through centralized competitive bidding, and paid a total of 5 billion yuan (excluding transaction costs), all of which will be used for the employee-shareholding plan, including, but not limited to, the long-term service plan approved by the company's general meeting.
Eli shares have paid $5.792 billion for share repurchase, and the use of repurchase shares has recently been adjusted from the original plan that "the repurchase shares will be used as the source of shares for the later implementation of the equity incentives" to "the accumulated repurchase of 183 million shares, of which 152 million shares will be used as the source of shares for the implementation of the equity incentives, and the remaining 3.49 million shares will be written off to reduce the registered capital."
Illy shares said the write-off of some of the repurchased shares would help further raise the level of earnings per share and improve the return on investment of the company's shareholders.
TCL Group on September 25 issued a progress announcement, TCL Group cumulative repurchase of 3.59% of the company shares, a total cost of 1.65 billion yuan.
The TCL Group's board office told Securities Daily that the repurchase would be used for employee equity plans, equity incentives or to convert convertible corporate bonds issued by listed companies.
TCL Group adheres to the established business strategy, continuous improvement of competitiveness, sustainable and healthy development.
Based on the confidence in the future development of the company and the protection of investors' interests, combined with the performance of the company's shares in the secondary market over the past year, and taking into account such factors as the company's operations and financial situation, the company plans to use its own funds, self-financing and other financing methods to buy back the company's shares.
Yang Delong, chief economist at Qianhai Kaiyuan Fund, said the repurchase of shares by listed companies had greatly boosted market confidence by reducing the number of shares in circulation and increasing earnings per share.
The repurchase of domestic listed companies has been increasing gradually in recent years, especially the outstanding shares. The repurchase of shares to boost investors' confidence is a very good way and is worthy of recognition and encouragement.
Hu Henghua, secretary of the Hunan Provincial Committee Standing Committee and the Changsha Municipal Committee, and the four leaders of the Hunan Army in engineering machinery manufacturing - Zhan Chunxin, Liang Shenggen, He Qinghua and Liu Feixiang - set a "small goal" around "changsha from engineering machinery to intelligent manufacturing" - to build a world-leading cluster of engineering machinery industry in three to five years.
In Changsha to build the world's leading level of engineering machinery industry cluster, in the current fashion, is to build "the strongest surface."
As the capital city of the inland province, Changsha shouted this boastful remark, how come?
By the power of leakage of hegemony.
The four engineering machinery Xiang enterprises participated in the dialogue, each with a mastery, covering the sky, underground, sea, land all fields: Mountain and river intelligent light aircraft, Zhonglian Heavy Section of concrete delivery pumps, Trinity Heavy Industries of all-ground cranes, iron construction heavy industries of tunnel shield machine, its "hard strength" can be said to be alone in the world, arrogant.
Once upon a time, China had little say in the field of engineering machinery manufacturing.
Time and tide change, Chinese enterprises "introduced" "go out" two-wheel drive, take advantage of the "one belt, one road" initiative, acquisitions, mergers, plants and other multi-pronged, leap into the global engineering machinery industry.
Among them, the leading enterprises in engineering machinery, such as Sanyi Heavy Industries, Zhonglian Heavy Industries, Iron and Steel Construction Heavy Industries and Shanhe Intelligent, have taken a significant lead in their output value, market share, sales and other major economic indicators.
It's a camera-driven momentum.
Xiangjun engineering machinery "Four Golden Gangs," is Changsha engineering machinery industry cluster's outstanding, is also the global engineering machinery industry's leading enterprises.
In the quagmire of global industry, who can live, and live well, is the hard way to speak.
Earlier years, the global engineering machinery industry suffered a cold winter, many internationally renowned engineering machinery manufacturing enterprises have fallen, but Changsha's engineering machinery manufacturing enterprises "cat winter" as "winter swim," self-imposed pressure, self-breakthrough, through the transformation of industrial structure, from manufacturing to intellectual, not only survived the past, but also strengthened the body.
By the stars of the moon of the political enterprises together.
Developing advantageous industries requires both enterprises to be aggressive and governments to be active.
Changsha's reputation as a "capital of engineering machinery" lies in the fact that it has gathered the entire industrial chain from upstream to downstream, created a number of clusters of related industries, and reduced the cost of R & D, manufacturing and sales by optimizing the business environment, improving supporting services and simplifying the approval process.
Good business ecology, so that engineering machinery manufacturing enterprises flocking to.
History has pushed Changsha to build the global engineering machinery leading level of the foreground, when I do not wait, when benevolent.
Whether the government, or the enterprises, or even the relevant industry and researchers and other links, should seize the opportunity, follow the trend, set their targets, and continue to make efforts to contribute to the construction of a strong and manufacturing Hunan.

Gansu Qingyang: Lake sheep pack to "out of poverty."
Autumn of September renders the Loess Plateau.
Xia Weili, a 58-year-old villager in Yima Township, fills the feeding trough in the sheep fold with the last shovel of grass and watches the white lake goats chew.
"Good delicious, wait for the autumn and winter full fat, the column can sell a good price."
He says he feeds sheep "special nutritious meals" every day, cleans them regularly, sterilizes them, and does not shy away from serving them well.
Harvey raised sheep for more than 20 years, until he came to work in a cooperative to learn how rough sheep had been.
Xia Weili is a villager from Yima Township, Qingcheng County, Qingyang City, Gansu Province.
His neighbours are sheep farmers, but adhere to the traditional way of dispersal, poor quality sheep, small column.
In June this year, under the guidance of the Government, 140 poor families in the village joined the cooperative, and everything began to change.
Harvey spent the whole day studying farming, for his heart was always choking.
The shareholders were all poor families who trusted the sheep to the cooperative and were counting on him to distribute the dividends and sell them at the end of the year.
Fortunately, with the guidance of technicians, he slowly learned to do epidemic prevention, mastered scientific feeding, became the village's few breeding "good handle."
The professional cooperative is a standardized cooperative, with 16 sheep sheds and nearly 1,400 lake sheep.
Zou Tao, the head of the cooperative, said standardized sheep shed inside and outside, there are doorways.
"The wool is thick and easy to breed bacteria. Lake goats can't stay in hot, humid places. The sheep shed must be built on three sides of the ditch.
Zou Tao said that in order to prevent the epidemic, sheep sheds also need regular spray disinfection, three to four times in the first quarter of the sheep vaccination.
In addition to living well, the Little Fat Sheep had to eat a mixture of silage corn, wheat straw, alfalfa, and a sufficiently wide playground to stretch their muscles.
Cooperatives have adopted the system of trusteeship and substitution to guide local farmers to put well-bred lake goats into the area for unified breeding, management and marketing, so as to achieve better breeding, scientific, standardized and intensive breeding.
Today, 140 poor households with shares in sheep receive more than 6,000 yuan a year in bonuses.
From "many mountains grazing" to "precise feeding," from "local mating" to "artificial insemination," from "looking at the size, feeling the belly" to "doing B-super one by one"... In Qingyang, Gansu Province, meat and sheep farming is not just a change in the way of feeding.
If market prices weaken, Zou said, the local leader Gansu Zhongsheng Agricultural and Livestock Development Co., Ltd., would buy at a market-protected price of 27 yuan per kilogram to help farmers spread market risks.
Xu Jianfeng, general adviser to Gansu-based Zhongsheng Agricultural Development Co., Ltd., said the company had helped more and more poor households read the "sheep jing" by providing loan guarantees, sheep-growing supplies, order farming, quotation purchases and unified processing and marketing services.
In Qingyang, at least 8,200 poor families have achieved a steady increase in their incomes through grass-raising, breeding of good seeds, large-scale farming, slaughter-splitting and market sales.
Qingyang is located in the north of the intersection of agriculture and animal husbandry, forage resources are rich.
At present, the city has 913 large-scale sheep farms and cooperatives, raising more than 5 million sheep, and has built two processing production lines on the scale of 1.3 million slaughtered sheep.
France's finance minister said he would cut taxes by more than 10 billion euros next year and called on Germany to follow suit
Paris (Reuters) - France will cut taxes by more than 10 billion euros ($10.9 billion) next year, while Germany should keep pace with France's fiscal stimulus to revive its flagging economy, France's finance minister said Thursday.
In introducing France's 2020 budget, Mr. Lemaire said the ECB's latest monetary easing created an opportunity for more investment by member governments that could afford it.
The European Central Bank cut interest rates to record lows on September 12 and plans to restart debt purchases to keep borrowing costs low, in the hope of stimulating economic recovery and boosting inflation.
"Low interest rates will not restore prosperity in Europe, and monetary policy measures are necessary but not sufficient," Mr Lemaire told reporters.
"Germany needs to invest, now, as soon as possible. Don't wait until things get worse," he added.
He has repeatedly made this appeal to Germany.
France has already implemented more than 10 billion euros in tax cuts this year, boosting its economic growth considerably.
And the global economy has lost momentum, with Germany's export-dependent economy bearing the brunt.
Le Maire notes that next year the tax burden on French households will be reduced by €9.3 billion, including a €5 billion income tax credit.
Furthermore, with the gradual implementation of the corporate tax rate, which will be reduced from 33.3 per cent to 25 per cent over a five-year period, the tax burden on enterprises will be reduced by almost Euro1 billion.

Study: The U.S. National Healthy Eating Index has grown modestly but remains a challenge - CNS
The U.S. government's index of healthy eating has risen moderately from 56 to 58 in 16 years, according to a new study.
But with a perfect score of 100, it's not worth celebrating.
Americans continue to face "significant challenges" in their diets.
Americans still eat too much food that can cause heart disease, diabetes and obesity, the most common diseases among Americans, said Dr. Margaret Chang, a nutrition researcher at Tufts University in Massachusetts and co-author of the study.
The study appears in the 24 th issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association.
The study was based on the findings of a government health survey of 44,000 adults conducted between 1999 and 2016.
"Despite significant improvements, significant dietary challenges remain," the authors write.
The challenges are known to include reducing the amount of saturated fat in snacks, hot dogs, fattening cattle and butter.
The study found that the intake of these unhealthy fats in people's diets increased from 11.5 percent to 12 percent, exceeding the recommended limit of 10 percent.
The biggest improvement in the U.S. national diet has been a reduction in sugar intake from 16% to about 14%, but it is still too high.
Officials say added sugar should be less than 10% of a person's diet.
The researchers linked the decrease in sugar intake to a reduction in drinking sweet soda, but Zhang stressed that sugar is often added to even less sweet foods, such as yogurt and ketchup.
Adult consumption of fruits, nuts, oats, and other whole grains increased slightly in the United States.
However, according to 2016 data, these foods still account for less than 5% of the daily diet.
Despite a slight reduction in salt intake and lower consumption of fruit juices, which leads to lower-quality carbohydrates, Zhang says they still account for up to 42 per cent of daily calories, many of which come from refined white bread and other refined grains.
The study was based on a biennial personal health survey that asked adults to recall what they had eaten in the past 24 hours.
These health surveys have asked this question twice every few days since 2003.
The U.S. government has issued guidelines for Americans to adopt a "healthy diet" to reduce the risk of chronic disease.
The guidelines state that people should eat more nutritious foods such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, as well as protein-rich seafood, lean meat, poultry meat, eggs and seeds.
The number of Americans with diabetes almost doubled, by more than 7%, during the study period, and the obesity rate increased over the years - about 70% of American adults are now overweight or obese.
Moreover, heart disease remains the leading cause of death in the United States.
EU promotes strategic partnerships with Asia
Members of the Politburo of the Communist Party of Viet Nam, the Secretary of the Central Secretariat and the Minister of Central Economic Affairs, Nguyễn Văn Bình, led a delegation to attend the forum.
In line with the close cooperation between the European Union and its partners in the Asia-Pacific region, the theme of the Forum was "European Union-Asia docking: Building bridges for a sustainable future."
The forum was held a year after the implementation of the European Union's two continental docking strategy.
Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, said the strengthening of the link was part of the idea because of the benefits it would bring to the peoples and economies concerned.
These relations have contributed to bringing stability and prosperity to the parties concerned.
He also believes that the EU wants to convey the message of increased participation and the consolidation of a mutually beneficial docking relationship between Europe and Asia.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan is a special guest of the Forum and will deliver an important speech at the plenary session.
Technology-enabled capital management for the country's first banking subsidiary
Everbright Bank's wholly owned subsidiary, Everbright Financial Management Co., Ltd., was formally established in Qingdao, China's first joint-stock bank financial management subsidiary.
Experts said that asset management is an important area for the development of financial technology, and the establishment of financial subsidiaries is conducive to the use of technology to enhance the management of capital.
In April, Everbright Bank and China Merchants Bank respectively issued announcements that they had obtained approval from the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission to set up financial management subsidiaries.
On September 24, the bank announced that Everbright Financial Services had officially been authorized to open.
Shortly after two days, Everbright Bank led a number of joint-stock banks, the first to establish Everbright Financial Management in Qingdao.
Li Xiaopeng, chairman of Everbright Group, said the group would accelerate its pace of innovation, use modern technological thinking and tools, rely on big data, the Internet of Things and cloud computing, increase the coverage, usage and penetration of financial capital, and enhance customers' sense of access, well-being and security.
By 2021, we will establish and improve the "four pillars and eight pillars" of China's financial science and technology development, further strengthen the application capabilities of financial science and technology, achieve deep integration and coordinated development between finance and science and technology, and visibly enhance the satisfaction of the people with digital, networked and intelligent financial products and services.
Zhang Xuyang, chairman of Everbright Financial Services, said that the Everbright Financial Services management platform will use such technologies as smart shopping, smart research and big data to help Everbright Financial Services better judge the macroeconomic situation.
In the future, blockchain and other new technologies will be used to grasp the direction and trends from traditional assets to alternative assets to digital alternatives.
Dong Ximiao, a specially hired researcher at the National Financial and Development Laboratory, said financial technology companies and regulators would use it to explore new growth paths in the face of new competition in the asset management industry.
Financial technology enabling the asset management industry is not only the need of financial technology itself transformation and development, but also will inject new vitality and vitality into the development of asset management business.
Earlier this year, Jingdong Digital Technology launched a new capital management technology system to enhance the R & D and wind control capabilities of capital management products with the help of technology and digitization.
The new system starts with the four capabilities of product design, sales transaction, asset management and risk assessment, and improves the overall intelligent operation level of the capital management industry.
Experts believe that asset management technology not only enhances customer service capability and innovative products, but also enhances risk prevention capability and asset management efficiency.
Mr Zhang said the use of artificial intelligence for user profiling, which used to skew clients' risk preferences by means of questionnaires, could help better target customers and defuse risks by tailoring products to their investment preferences.
"Other kinds of big data, such as e-commerce and spatial and temporal data, can help us better characterize the activity and prosperity of a region and an industry."
While mitigating risks, big data technology will also help improve wind control capabilities, Zhang said.
Record deepest railway tunnel shaft in China
Zhang Weimingxu Zhou Jingbo, China's top railway tunnel shaft depth of 762.59 meters, broke the record for the deepest shaft in a Chinese railway tunnel after more than 1,200 days of day and night construction.
Located in Yunnan Province, the 34.5-kilometre-long Dalian-Shanghai railway tunnel crosses the Goligon Mountains from the coast of Jiangxi Province, making it the longest double-track single-tunnel tunnel in Asia.
The tunnel traverses 19 fracture zones, with a maximum burial depth of 1,155 metres, and is known as the "Geological Museum" of tunnel construction because it covers almost all of the adverse geological and significant risks that can be encountered in tunnel construction.
Shafts are the most important auxiliary tunnels in the Goligong Hill Tunnel, and shoulder loading increases the operating surface to achieve the "long tunnel short hit" and the ventilation of the later railway operations.
Shaft 1 was successfully dug to the bottom of the well, marking the formal entry of the Goligon Hill Tunnel into horizontal tunnel construction.
"The vertical wells are all in granite formations, because the granite formations are more cracks, not water, from up to down continuously, basically how deep the wells have much water pressure."
Zheng Jingzhao, chief engineer of the Dalian Railway Project Department of the China Railway Tunneling Bureau, told reporters that during the shaft construction, there were many dangerous situations such as mudslides and water collapses.
"The maximum inflow in a shaft is over 300 cubic metres per hour, and the bottom of the shaft is over 700 metres deep, with a water pressure equivalent to 700 metres of seafloor."
"If we don't pump and drain in time, we'll flood the well by 10 meters in an hour," he said. "We spend almost 85 percent of our time treating the water and 15 percent of our time digging in."
In order to overcome geological difficulties such as vertical joint development, mud inrush and water-rich granite in the perimeter of No. 1 shaft, the tunnel construction adopts a combination of "exploration, injection and excavation" system water control measures to reduce the construction risks.
After many improvements, the No. 1 shaft construction has formed a mechanical pipeline of excavation system, ballast release system, suspension system, winch lifting system and so on.
Eventually, after more than 1,200 days of day and night work, the shaft was successfully dug to a depth of 762.59 metres.
With a total length of 330 km, the railway is an important part of the China-Myanmar International Corridor and an important transportation infrastructure in the implementation of the Belt and Road Initiative.
After the completion of the road, the travel time from Dali to Ruili will be reduced from 6 hours to 2 hours, greatly improving the transportation pattern in western Yunnan and promoting economic and trade cooperation and friendly exchanges between China and South and Southeast Asian countries.

Since its return to the motherland, Hong Kong has been closely associated with the Mainland, working hand in hand to make progress and share fruitful achievements.
We believe that under the premise of "one country, two systems," Hong Kong can continue to develop its advantages in the future, seize the opportunities of the Belt and Road Initiative, Guangdong, Hong Kong, Macao and the Bay Area, and seek a better future for Hong Kong.
She also said that over the past few months, Hong Kong has seen social controversy, affecting everyone in Hong Kong, and journalists have faced different challenges.
At this critical juncture, it is our hope that our friends in the media will continue to rise to the occasion, work with professionalism, provide fair and balanced news for the community, and do their part for the future of Hong Kong and the return of rational communication and dialogue.
In his speech, Jiang noted that the glorious history of the New China is also the history of Hong Kong's development, common progress, ties of blood, honour and disgrace with the motherland.

Afternoon began to be lonely, and do not want to go out, have not adjusted the children not around the state.
Take heart and say to Nana, "Mommy will take you out."
Detailedly wrote out to do a few things, the characteristics of type A blood more and more tough, they feel very awkward.
Take suit, buy nutritious grains, pay, buy raw fish, Nana small snacks.
These are the reasons for going out.
In the phone, just to my sister Aisha said thanks to Nana, or even to buy snack excuses have no.
There were a few perfunctory laughs, said the child to the phone and hung up.
Nana jumped into the carriage and down on her feet, knowing she was seasick, frightened, and unwilling to accompany me.
My husband Beau seldom comes back early.
After praising the delicious salmon-and-butter salad, he went to his bedroom and lay in bed watching TV.
Look at the clock on the wall, just 7 o'clock, sunrise country sunset is also early, it has been dark.
The circle of friends are inventing the moon, it turned out that today is the Mid-Autumn Festival.
Wash a bunch of grapes sent by friends, leave half to Beau, the remainder in a favorite small flower bowl, take out to see the moon.
And Nana sat on the ground, and I ate the grapes, and she ate the skins: And I spake the seeds of the grapes far away.
The moon is hidden in the clouds, but as the clouds go on, the moon will suddenly appear, a bit glaring.
All the poems about the moon surged in my mind, but I only liked this one very clearly: Whenever three or five people are reunited / All the jade columns are covered with light / The sky is lifted only once / All the names on earth look up.
Maybe we give too much emotion to the moon, for me now, in fact, that God to God, Caesar to Caesar is the best.
The moon turns to the moon, the mood to yourself.
Having eaten the grapes, this regiment of cold moon is cold.
Nana snored a little at her feet, got up, and laid Nana's little blanket on the edge of her little house, on which she lay cheerfully.
Open the door and shout: Was the bath water boiling?
From the bathroom window can not see the moon, can only feel the moonlight, turn off the bathroom lights, open the glass.
No mooncakes, no drinks.

Starting next year, Chinese students can apply for undergraduate studies in Germany on the basis of their entrance examination results
Starting in 2020, Chinese high school graduates will be able to apply directly to German universities for undergraduate degrees on the basis of their college entrance examination results, without first registering at a domestic university, the German database Anabin, which evaluates and certifies academic qualifications abroad, announced on its website.
Prior to this, Chinese high school graduates who wanted to apply to German universities had to study for one semester (211,985 undergraduates) or three semesters (general undergraduates) at home and pass the APS or TestAS examinations.
The release of the new rules may save at least half a year for Chinese students wishing to study in Germany.
It is understood that the new regulation will come into effect in the second half of 2019.
Applicants are required to complete 12 years of formal compulsory education, obtain a high school diploma, take the Common Entrance Examination (CEE) and the National College Entrance Examination (NCEE) with a score of 70% or more (or 525 or more if the total score is 750), and have completed two languages and a mathematics or natural sciences degree.
In addition, the specific professional requirements for college entrance examination results are not the same.
For example, for medical, dental, veterinary, and pharmaceutical majors, the college entrance examination must include at least two subjects in mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, or a science course; for law majors, the college entrance examination must include at least two subjects in foreign languages, history, geography, or a liberal arts course.
According to incomplete statistics, there are a number of countries including Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and other recognized China's college entrance examination results.
In the United Kingdom, for example, universities such as Cambridge, Birmingham and Leicester accept Chinese students to study on the basis of their entrance examination results.
Military "robot dogs" take acting lessons first Sun Theater: Consider being included in the lineup.
The U. S. military has funded the development of "machine dogs" for the battlefield, and may now be the first on the circus stage!
The Sun Circus said it was in talks with Boston Dynamics, the company that developed the robot, about the feasibility of using it in circus performances.
Boston Dynamics announced Thursday that a four-legged robot, Spot, is an agile mobile robot that can weigh up to 14 kg, has a high degree of mobility adapted to cross-country terrain, 360-degree obstacle avoidance, navigation, remote control and autonomy.
In particular, Spot has a proprietary software platform specifically developed for Spot, which allows users to customize the capabilities of the Spot robot through a variety of applications.
The idea of a robotic dog was first published by Boston Dynamics in 1992, which was a sensation at the time, but has not yet been used commercially.
Boston Dynamics, however, noted that Spot is now in the mass-produced stage, with subscriptions dominated by construction and energy companies.
The circus is also in talks with Boston-based Power Technologies Inc. The circus said the project is still in the conceptual stages and is evaluating the potential of Spot for use in live performances.
State Council Press Office Releases White Paper on China and the World in a New Era
On the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Press Office of the State Council released a white paper entitled "China and the World in a New Era."
Xu Lin, Vice-Minister of Communications and Director of the State Council's Information Office, said the white paper would systematically describe China's development achievements, paths and trends, and elaborate in-depth on China's relations with the world, focusing on such issues as "where China has come from and where it is heading," "what kind of world China is pushing to build" and "how a developing China is getting along with the world," with a view to enhancing the international community's knowledge and understanding of China's development.

Does MCA stand in the by-election for the state council seat in Denver?
MCA president Dato 'Seri Wei Jiaxiang: "The Supreme Council of the Communist Party of China discuss!"
With a by-election for Thandumbiai's seat looming, it is a matter of concern whether the MCA, a member party of Barisan Nasional, will take up the traditional seat.
However, after a meeting of the MCA Central Committee, it was announced that the Supreme Council of Barisan Nasional would decide whether the traditional MCA seat should continue to be allocated to the MCA or be replaced by another member party.
After chairing a meeting of the MCA Central Committee Thursday afternoon, Wei told the media that any by-election would be conducted in accordance with standard operating procedures, which require a meeting of the Supreme Council of the National Front before a decision can be made.
He said that since the Election Commission would not meet until next Monday (January) to finalize the by-election for the seat of Thandubyai, the Supreme Council of BN was expected to convene in early October.
Yesterday morning (26th), I also met with the Chairman of the National Front, Dato 'Seri Ahmadzahi, and we all agreed on the need to regain this seat from the League of Hope.
"We are scheduled to convene a special RUF leadership meeting in early October, at which the RUF three-party leaders will determine which member party will take part."
Inquiring whether MCA would insist on taking the traditional seat on the National Front Supreme Council, Wei reiterated that, as MCA president, he must act in accordance with standard operating procedures and that any decision must be made by consensus of the National Front.
"In any by-election, it is common for people to be willing to go, for there are parties, for there is a certain side that thinks they should go," he said.
"The most important thing is, from what organizations and political alliances do we come?
"It's a great test of our years of forming a political coalition, and we believe that Barisan Nasional has come along with some valuable values," he said.
"It's not surprising that someone might say something in the process," he said.
"However, once the Supreme Council of the National Front has made a decision, it is most valuable that everyone prepares for war with all their might."
In any event, Wei said, MCA will work at three levels, namely the District Council, the State Board and the Central Committee, to prepare for the upcoming by-election.
"The regional councils will be headed by Governor (Dandubyai) Sly Wong-il, Chairman of the Regional Council; the state boards will be headed by Governor Lin Pei-hing, Acting Chairman of the Juzhou Board; and the central committees will be deployed by Governor (Acting) Ma Han-shun and Secretary (General) Zhang Sheng-wen."
Governor Mohammad Ali, a member of Parliament from the indigenous Unity Party of Thandumbiai, died at the age of 42 from a heart attack at the Tunjan Government Hospital on Saturday.
A villager in Baokang County, Hubei Province, was ordered to "compulsorily patrol the mountains" for hunting wildlife
A villager in Baokang County, Hubei Province, was sentenced for hunting wildlife and ordered to pay 15,420 yuan (RMB) in damages to ecological resources and the environment.
Due to the indigence of the defendant's family, procuratorial organs used alternative labor to compensate for the cost of ecological restoration, thus achieving the organic unification of legal and social effects.
Wang Zhongliang, deputy chief prosecutor of Baokang County Public Prosecutor's Office, said the defendant Zhou had developed deep feelings with wild macaques and blamed himself for his predatory behavior through three months of "compulsory mountain patrol" and other alternative labor.
On June 21, this year, Baokang County Public Prosecutor's Office filed a criminal incidental civil prosecution in the field of ecological resources, in the county court public hearing and sentencing in court.
The defendant, Zhou Mou, was sentenced to three years' imprisonment, suspended for four years, and fined 3,000 yuan, while ordering him to pay 15,420 yuan for the restoration of ecological resources and environmental damage.
According to the investigation, Zhou began to set up a power grid on the cliffs in late January 2014 and hunted more than 20 wildlife, including antelope, suede and deer.
Speckled antelope belongs to the second level of national endangered wildlife conservation, small suede, hairy crown deer are listed as the National Land Wildlife Conservation List.
During the court hearing, Zhou admitted his wrongful facts and acts, and willing to bear the incidental civil liability.
However, considering the poor economic situation of Zhou's family, under the coordination of the Baokang County Public Prosecutor's Office, the local village committee, forestry station and Zhou reached an agreement on alternative labor compensation for ecological restoration expenses: That is, Zhou provided public welfare services to compensate for ecological restoration expenses by carrying out domestication and management work, compulsory mountain patrol and forest protection in the village's macaque reserve for one year.
The court accepted the prosecutor's recommendation and agreed to commit Zhou to a suspended sentence while actively fulfilling the obligation of "alternative labour to compensate for the cost of ecological restoration."
At present, Zhou has been in the monkey sanctuary 3 months of compulsory labor, active mountain patrol, good performance.
In recent years, Baokang County Public Prosecutor's Office has integrated procuratorial functions and social governance behaviors into practice, scientifically applied procuratorial suggestions, investigative supervision and litigation supervision to minimize the damage to the ecological environment caused by criminal acts by judicial means.
United Nations Earthguard Award for Ant Forest
In the warm applause and magnificent music, the ant forest project leader Xu Di and user representative Shen Junliang stepped onto the podium to receive the trophy of the 2019 United Nations Champions of the Earth Award from the moderator.
At the 2019 Earthguard Awards ceremony in New York City, the Ant Forest project, which uses mobile phone apps to engage hundreds of millions of people in environmental activism, was awarded the Incentive and Action Award.
A week ago, the United Nations Environment Programme announced the winners at its headquarters in Nairobi, Kenya, but the ceremony remained an emotional one.
In an interview with Xinhua News Agency, the Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme, Ying E. Annan, said the ant forest was an exciting innovation that enabled hundreds of millions of people to act to understand the environmental challenges facing humanity and what humanity can do for the environment.
It will have a tremendous impact by connecting people and their environments with technology, allowing each individual to participate in actions to protect the planet.
Launched in August 2016 by China's Ant Financial Services Group ( ant gold suit), AntForest allows users to save "green energy" and "plant trees" on their mobile phones by recording their daily green trips, paying for utilities online and other low-carbon actions in AntForest.
For each virtual tree that users develop, Ant Forest and its public-interest partners plant a real tree in a desertified area.
As of August this year, 500 million "ant forest" users have reduced cumulative carbon emissions by 7.92 million tons and planted 122 million trees in desertified areas.
The President of Costa Rica, Carlos Alvarado, who received the award for his country's environmental efforts at the Earthguard Awards on the same day, praised Ant Forest's contributions as "impressive in inspiring so many people to take part in green action."
The Champions of the Earth award is a recognition of the Ant Forest project, said Kendong Ii, chairman and chief executive officer of Ant Gold.
Technology and open platforms made it possible for everyone to participate in a low-carbon life, an honour that belonged to all participants.
He said the ant forests had affected 500 million people over the past three years and that the goal of the ant forests over the next three years was to engage 1 billion people worldwide in low-carbon actions.
While combating desertification and protecting the environment, they are also exploring ways to increase farmers' incomes from green mountains and waters.
In addition to providing employment through tree planting, it hopes to help farmers increase their incomes through agricultural development projects and e-commerce platforms.
The digital technology-based public-interest environmental model created by Ant Forest has also been successfully replicated in other countries.
In June, GCash, the largest e-wallet in the Philippines, launched the Philippine version of Ant Forest, encouraging Filipino users to better protect the environment through a low-carbon lifestyle.
GCash plans to plant 365,000 trees in the Philippines within a year of the project's launch, in partnership with the Department of Environment and Natural Resources of the Philippines and environmental groups.
The Champions of the Earth Award, the highest United Nations award in the field of environmental protection, is presented annually.
The ant forest won the "Incentive and Action Award" for the third consecutive year for a green innovation project from China, following the project of "Thousand Village Demonstration and Ten Thousand Village Remediation" in Zhejiang Province, which was built by China's Sehanba Forestry Project.
Economic and trade frictions affect the U.S. economy "report card."
Us GDP growth slowed sharply from the previous quarter as a result of a sharp decline in private-sector investment and exports, according to the U.S. economic "report card" for the second quarter.
Analysts said trade frictions and uncertainty were the main reasons for the decline in private-sector investment and exports in the second quarter.
The final revised figures, released by the Commerce Department on Monday, showed annualized GDP growth of 2% in the second quarter, the same as the revised figures, but significantly lower than the 3.1% rise in the first quarter.
Data show that consumption growth was the main factor underpinning US growth in the second quarter.
Personal consumption spending, which accounts for about 70 per cent of the U.S. economy, rose by 4.6 per cent in the quarter-to-quarter cycle, driving growth by 3.03 percentage points.
Moreover, government consumption expenditure and investment boosted economic growth by 0.82 percentage points.
However, private-sector investment fell 6.3 per cent in the second quarter from the previous quarter, dragging down growth by 1.16 percentage points; exports fell 5.7 per cent from the previous quarter, and net exports dragged down growth by 0.68 percentage points.
Barry Knap, managing partner at Ainside Macroeconomic Consulting, said private-sector investment had not only failed to maintain last year's growth momentum, but had declined sharply, as rising economic friction and uncertainty had hit business confidence.
Under the influence of policy uncertainty, capital expenditure by U. S. companies is expected to remain in a downward trend next year, according to Mr. Knap.
Analysts believe that while consumer growth strongly supported the U.S. economy in the second quarter, there are increasing signs that trade frictions and the uncertainty they create have affected consumer confidence and have had a negative impact on the U.S. consumer outlook.
Richard Curtin, a professor of economics at the University of Michigan, who led the survey, said in a recent survey 38 percent of consumers made spontaneous reference to the negative impact of tariffs on the U.S. economy, the highest percentage in a year and a half.
Analysts are generally of the view that the U. S. economy will continue to slow.
But experts also said the performance of the U.S. industrial sector and financial markets would improve if trade frictions were eased.
The U.S. economy is expected to continue its downward trend this year and grow at a slower pace than in the second quarter, according to global economist Kathleen Birch of the think tank The Economist Intelligence Unit.
Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytica, predicts that the U.S. economy will grow by 2.3% this year and slow further to 1.6% next year, assuming economic frictions do not escalate.
Ellen Hatzen, investment manager at Patnam Investments, noted that the biggest concern for companies today is trade disputes and the uncertainty they create, and that if trade disputes were resolved, uncertainty would be greatly reduced and the performance of the industry sector would be much better than it is now.
Matt Melly, equity strategist at Miller-Tabac Asset Management, said trade frictions remained the "first priority" and the main cause of the volatility in U.S. capital markets this year, and whether they were properly addressed would be the key to the direction of U.S. capital markets for the rest of the year.
The first joint parental leave for couples in Ningxia will be 10 days a year for parents of children aged 0 to 3
Safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of women is an expression of respect for and protection of human rights and an important sign of the progress of social civilization.
On September 27, at the fifteenth session of the Standing Committee of the Twelfth National People's Congress of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, the Regulations on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Women in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region were adopted by a high vote.
This is Ningxia's first provincial-level comprehensive and systematic local regulation on safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of women, which will be formally implemented on 1 November 2019.
It is understood that the Regulations adopted at this time were revised on the basis of the Measures for the Implementation of the Law of the People's Republic of China on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Women in Ningxia in 2007.The Regulations are divided into 9 chapters and 65 articles, including general provisions, political rights, cultural and educational rights, labour and social security rights, property rights, personal rights, marital and family rights, legal responsibilities and by-laws.
In the Regulations, Ningxia encourages the exploration and implementation of joint parental leave for couples, which is the first of its kind in the country.
In April this year, the State Council Office issued the Guiding Opinions on Promoting the Development of Child Care Services for Children Under 3 Years of Age, which describes joint parenting for couples.
In the process of amending the Regulations, Ningxia has innovated by proposing that "Employers are encouraged to grant each spouse ten days of joint parental leave per year for children between the ages of 0 and 3 years to couples who have children in accordance with the laws and regulations."
At the same time, the Regulation highlights the protection against sexual harassment and female minors.
Article 43 of the Regulations incorporates the latest legislative achievements in China's current codification of human rights in the Civil Code, and details the constituent elements of sexual harassment, the subjects and mechanisms for combating sexual harassment.
Article 44 of the Ordinance, which explicitly prohibits the frequent occurrence of sexual abuse of girls and requires educational institutions to carry out related education, protection and prevention work, is a new benchmark for the protection of girls in local legislation.
With regard to women's right to know and dispose of the common property of a married family, article 35 of the Regulations clearly stipulates women's right to know about the common property and the obligations of property registration agencies and related subjects, providing solid institutional support for women's rights.
Furthermore, in response to the social hotspot of gender discrimination in employment, article 26 of the Regulations prohibits not only direct discrimination but also indirect discrimination, and incorporates the recent experience of joint interviewing practices to strengthen the punishment of offences of gender discrimination and to better defend women's legitimate rights and interests.
In recent years, the Joint Public Prosecution and Law Division of the Ningxia Women's Union and civil affairs departments have promoted and introduced social professional forces to mediate marital and family conflicts and work against domestic violence, with remarkable results.
The Regulations summarize and promote this, and a number of laws and regulations encourage the mobilization of social forces and the accumulation of social resources to jointly safeguard women's rights and interests, and require people's governments at and above the county level to provide stable and institutional safeguards and support, including through the purchase of services.
Academician Yuan Longping of the Xing'an League of Inner Mongolia works station salt-tolerant rice yields 1,000 jin of rice per mu
Reporters 27 from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Xin'an League Administration Office, Li Li recently held "Xing'an League Yuan Longping academician work station salinity-tolerant rice on-site yield measurement and acceptance of the evaluation council" good news, salinity-tolerant rice yields an average of 1,000 jin of rice.
A team of six experts from Heilongjiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Yangzhou University and Hunan Provincial Agricultural and Rural Affairs Department sampled and harvested rice from the "Xing salt series."
After expert evaluation, the average rice yield of saline-tolerant rice per mu was 508.8 kg on land with pH of 8.8 to 9.6 and salinity content of 5 ‰ to 6 ‰.
"Our next plan is to innovate and reform on the basis of this year's experiments, and to re-cultivate and optimize salt-tolerant rice varieties so as to achieve better quality and higher yields," said Wang Shigang, director of the workstation of Yuan Longping, a fellow of the Xing'an League.
"On the premise that the factors of production remain unchanged, I believe that we will continue to strengthen our scientific and technological efforts and that salt-tolerant rice will continue to do wonders on the salt-alkali soil," said Lai Yongcai, a researcher and deputy director of the Heilongjiang Agricultural Sciences Academy and head of the production measurement team.
Xing'an League belongs to the southern foothills of the Great Xing'an Mountains concentrated in a series of special hardship areas.
In October 2018, Yuan Longping's work station was unveiled at the Xing'an League.
Academician Yuan Longping led a team of experts to speed up the introduction and promotion of the newly bred "salinity-tolerant hybrid rice" varieties and advanced technologies, and to build a 960-acre salt-tolerant rice base at the right-wing center flag of Qingqin.
The on-site yield measurement of salt-tolerant rice not only provides hope for the upgrading of medium and low-yielding paddy fields to medium and high-yielding paddy fields in Xing'an League, but also provides scientific basis for the cultivation of paddy in salt-alkali areas under the same conditions in China.
After a marathon of debates and weeks of protests, Australia's new state passed legislation legalizing abortion on September 26, AFP reported.
It is reported that the bill has sparked political debate over the past eight weeks and that there have been serious divisions within the Liberal Party of Australia since independent MP Greenwich announced the introduction of the bill.
After nearly 40 hours of discussion, the Senate passed the bill by 26 votes to 14, making it the third longest-running bill in the Senate.
On the morning of the 26th, after a final vote in the New State House of Representatives, abortion was legalized in the new state.
The Act allows a woman to terminate her pregnancy at the 22nd week of pregnancy and to have an abortion later in the pregnancy if two doctors agree.
The Senate passed an amendment on the evening of the 25th that would allow doctors to seek advice from a multidisciplinary team of hospital advisory boards before performing an abortion on a woman who is 22 weeks pregnant.
In addition, the amendments passed by the Senate included the requirement that doctors must provide appropriate care for surviving infants after termination of pregnancy.
Earlier, the new governor, Beryl Glynn, had faced public criticism from conservatives on the bill, and she had intervened several times to gain more debate time for the bill, but did not attend the final vote.
"I need to spend time running the new state," she said in defense of her absence.
Liberal MP John Davis, who was one of the strongest opponents of the abortion bill, has threatened to withdraw from the new state government and called it a "government crisis."
But then Davis made concessions.
"The amendments to the legalization of abortion bill that were tabled in the House of Representatives on the morning of the 26th actually provide more protection for women and doctors," Davis said.
Meanwhile, the leader of Australia's new state National Party, Barry Laro, said he was proud to be part of a government that legalized abortion.
"What we achieved last night is historic for the new state. It legalizes abortion, it is no longer a crime, and it does not treat women who have abortions as criminals," he said.

Minister of Finance Liu Kun: 67 central enterprises and financial institutions have transferred 860.1 billion yuan of state capital to strengthen the Social Security Fund.
To date, 67 central enterprises and central financial institutions have completed transferring some state-owned capital to strengthen social security funds, bringing the total transferred state-owned capital to about 860.1 billion yuan, Finance Minister Liu Kun said on Tuesday.
Liu Kun made the above-mentioned statement at the task deployment meeting on transferring part of the state-owned capital to strengthen the social security fund, which was jointly convened by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security and the State Capital Commission on the same day.
"The transfer of part of the state-owned capital to enrich the social security fund is an important initiative to reform and improve the basic old-age insurance system, a full reflection of the achievements of the development of state-owned enterprises for all and the intergenerational equity of the basic old-age insurance system, and a policy measure based on the present and taking into account the long-term perspective."
In 2017, the State Council issued the Implementation Programme for Transferring Some State-Owned Capital to Enrich the Social Security Fund, which requires selecting some central enterprises and some provinces to carry out pilot projects.
According to Liu Kun, the transfer of early work has achieved positive results.
At the central level, three batches of 67 central enterprises and central financial institutions have been transferred, bringing the total transferred state-owned capital to about 860.1 billion yuan.
Among them, the transfer of central financial institutions from the Ministry of Finance to fulfil the responsibilities of contributors has been largely completed.
The transfer of central enterprises has reached a certain scale.
At the local level, the early stage of enterprise transfer has been carried out successively.
By the end of 2018, the pilot projects in Zhejiang and Yunnan provinces had basically been completed, transferring 15.8 billion yuan and 18.5 billion yuan of state-owned capital, respectively.
In addition to the pilot provinces, other provinces have carried out the pre-transition preparation work, laying the foundation for the next step of carrying out the transfer.
According to a joint circular issued by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the State Administration of Finance, the General Administration of Taxation and the CSRC, the transfer of some state-owned capital from central to local governments to strengthen social security funds will be fully launched in 2019 and will be completed by 2020.
At the meeting held on the same day, a specific deployment was made for the full roll-out.
It was emphasized that the transfer should be carried out in a pragmatic and efficient manner.
According to the schedule, the transfer will be substantially completed by 2020.
Transfer work time is tight, the task is heavy. "
Liu said that all regions and departments should carefully organize and arrange to ensure that the transfer work is completed in accordance with the requirements; push forward the work and grasp the contents of the transfer policy accurately; and strengthen communication and coordination to resolve difficult issues in a timely manner.
Transfer of state funds to strengthen social security funds - Starting with "Strengthening the Social Security Fund Moneybag," the goal is to provide strong support for old-age security.
However, the author believes that this is not a simple equity "physical displacement," but a "mathematical addition."
On September 20, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Rights and Social Welfare, the State Capital Commission, the General Administration of Taxation and the CSRC jointly issued the "Notice on the Comprehensive Opening of the Work of Transferring Parts of State-owned Capital for the Enrichment of Social Security Funds," clarifying the timetable for transferring state-owned capital for social security funds, i.e., the central and local transfers of part of state-owned capital for the enrichment of social security funds will be fully opened in 2019.
Following the publication of the document, the Ministry of Finance and other departments implemented very quickly.
On September 25, the Ministry of Finance transferred 10% of ICBC and Agricultural Bank shares to the Social Security Fund, with a total value of more than $115 billion.
According to the regulations, social security foundations and other undertaking entities, as financial investors, enjoy the right to income, disposal and knowledge of state-owned shares.
ICBC and Agricultural Bank said in the announcement that the equity changes will not lead to the Bank's controlling shareholders and actual controllers of the change.
In this respect, the author thinks that the similar transfer of state-owned shares is not a simple change of ownership, but can stimulate a series of effects of "addition operation."
The first step of transferring some state-owned funds to social security is "adding results," which can naturally reflect the ownership of all state-owned enterprises and the sharing of development results.
After many years of reform and development, state-owned enterprises, especially central enterprises, are mostly in important industries and fields in China's economy, and their overall profitability is strong and stable.
Among them, the leading enterprises are continuously achieved to do a great deal to do better.
On July 10, the Standing Committee of the State Council decided to start the work of transferring part of the state-owned capital to enrich the Social Security Fund in an all-round way this year.
The Ministry of Finance immediately said it would work with relevant departments, in accordance with the deployment of the Standing Committee of the State Council, to fully open up and transfer some state-owned capital to enrich the social security fund, fully reflecting the intergenerational equity of the basic pension insurance system and the results of the development of state-owned enterprises to be shared by all.
The second step of the transfer, the addition result, is to strengthen the sustainability of China's social security funds and further consolidate the foundation of the old-age social security system.
With the aging of the population, China's social security funds are under pressure, and this time as the transferred main body of state capital, most of the profits and dividends can not only effectively supplement the social security funds, but also provide a source of live water for the social security funds.
Some calculations show that each transfer of 3.8 percentage points of state-owned capital, enterprises can support the basic pension insurance contribution rate reduced by 1 percentage point.
The third step of the transfer, "adding results," is to add stabilizers to capital markets.
This transferred to receive the main body of the way is "the main dividends, operation as a supplementary."
Social security funds, as financial investors of state-owned capital, do rely mainly on earnings from equity dividends.
However, social security funds, as value investors in capital markets, have a strong capability of capital operation.
As for listed assets in state-owned capital, the participation of social security funds in shareholding will further optimize the corporate governance structure of listed enterprises, promote enterprises' operational level, and have a positive impact on listed companies and capital markets.
At the same time, the social security fund as the investment trend, the enhancement of equity ownership is conducive to further strengthen its influence in the market, and plays a "stabilizer" role in the market.
In addition, it is also conducive to give full play to the "value discovery" function of institutional investors, guide investors to rational investment, value investment.

U.S. Senate approves Sculley as Labor Secretary - Official website
Washington, September 26 (Xinhua) - The United States Senate voted on President Donald Trump's nomination of Eugene Scalia as Labor Secretary on September 26.
The vote was 53 to 44, with no Democrats voting in favour of Scalia.
Republicans say Mr Scalia's curriculum vitae makes him ideally suited to become labor secretary.
But in the eyes of Democrats, Scalia has long stood in opposition to workers and trade unions in his career as a lawyer.
Scalia will succeed Alexander Acosta.
In July, under intense public pressure, then-Labour Secretary Gloria Macapagal-Ar Costa announced her resignation after being accused of "leniency" over the alleged sexual assault and trafficking of teenage girls by US billionaire Geoffrey Epstein.
Scalia, 56, is a partner in a prominent U.S. law firm and the son of former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
The Department of Labor is the cabinet-level department of the United States federal government responsible for labor-related matters.
The White House also issued a statement the same day that Trump has nominated the Federal Emergency Response Agency Acting Director Peter Geithner to officially lead the agency.
According to the procedure, Geithner's nomination must also be approved by the Senate of Congress.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is an agency of the United States Department of Homeland Security that coordinates federal government resources for emergency response to natural disasters and terrorist attacks in the United States.

Iran Confirmed to Develop Advanced Centrifuge Further Suspends Iran's Nuclear Agreement
The United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said on Sunday that Iran has violated its nuclear agreement once again by using advanced centrifuges to enrich uranium, the Central News Agency reported.
Iran is reportedly gradually violating the limits of its nuclear deal in response to US President Donald Trump's withdrawal from the deal in May 2018 and the resumption and strengthening of sanctions against Iran.
Iran suspended two other commitments in July, to keep its stockpile of enriched uranium below 300 kg and its purity not to exceed 3.67 per cent, and has now moved further.
According to the nuclear agreement, Iran could only install about 5,000 first-generation IR-1 centrifuges at Natanz to accumulate enriched uranium, and only a small number of more advanced models were allowed to be used for research, but no enriched uranium was produced.
If Iran succeeds in developing a more advanced centrifuge, it will be able to produce enriched uranium several times faster, possibly for use in a nuclear bomb.
According to the report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) stated: "On 25 September, the Agency confirmed that advanced centrifuges developed by Iran for models 2 and 3... were accumulating or were ready to accumulate enriched uranium."
"They're busy at the [Natanz uranium enrichment] facility," a diplomatic official responded when the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) presented the report to member states on Monday.

Italy's education minister has proposed a sugar tax to protect public health.
Lorenzo Fioramonti, education minister in Italy's new government and a member of the Five Star Movement, has tabled a motion in parliament proposing a new tax on sugary beverages, snacks and airline tickets.
According to reports, the Italian government will levy a snack tax on sugary beverages, snacks and other foods that are harmful to health, as well as an environmental tax on airline tickets of €1 for domestic flights and €1.5 for international flights, according to a bill proposed by Education Minister Giovanni Fioramonti.
Fioramonti said the Italian government expected to collect 3 billion euros in tax revenues from this seemingly small package.
The proceeds of this tax will be used in the areas of education, health and environmental protection.
In response, Italian Prime Minister Matteo Conte said he believed it was a feasible solution, while Italian parliamentarian and European Union leader Matteo Salvini tweeted sarcastically, "Please hurry up and hide desserts, biscuits, bread and candy because the new government is going to start levying snack taxes."
The report noted that the snack tax refers to sugary beverages, high-calorie food tax on a special tax.
The levying of the tax contributes to public health benefits.
On the evening of September 25 local time, the Chinese Embassy in Canada hosted a reception in Ottawa to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
Ottawa, September 26 (Reuters) - China's new ambassador to Canada, Cong Peiwu, hosted a reception in Ottawa on the evening of September 25 to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
In his speech, Cong Pei-wu said that in the 70 years since the founding of New China, under the strong leadership of the Communist Party of China and the concerted efforts of the Chinese people, the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics had achieved remarkable achievements that had not only profoundly changed the face of China, benefited its people, but also had far-reaching global significance.
Based on its own national conditions, China has pioneered a path of socialism with Chinese characteristics, expanded the way for developing countries to modernize, and contributed to the solution of human problems with Chinese wisdom and Chinese programmes.
The picture shows the participants stopping to watch a photo exhibition on the theme of the 70th Anniversary of New China.
Cong Peiwu said that China has created a rare miracle in the history of world human development and made an important contribution to promoting world peace and development.
China adheres to an independent foreign policy of peace, has always advocated the five principles of peaceful coexistence as the core of the basic norms of international relations, and is a builder of world peace, a contributor to global development and a defender of international order.
The development of China has provided new opportunities for the development of all countries in the world, including Canada, benefiting all peoples.
Mr. Cong emphasized that the nearly 50 years of development of China-Canada relations had shown that only by upholding the principles of equality and mutual respect could the two countries' relations move forward on the right track.
Conversely, relations between the two countries would be frustrated and their interests undermined.
At present, China-Canada relations are experiencing serious difficulties, and the responsibility lies not with China.
The bell is still ringing.
We hope that Canada will soon come up with appropriate solutions to the outstanding issues in bilateral relations, so as to create conditions for the two countries to return to normal relations.
More than 700 guests attended the reception, including government officials, federal senators, friends from all walks of life, ambassadors to Canada, and representatives of overseas Chinese, Chinese-funded institutions and overseas students.
Chinese Embassy officials Chen Mingjian and Heng Xiaojun attended the reception.
The ceremony featured a photo exhibition on the theme of the 70th anniversary of the founding of New China, along with promotional videos such as "China 2019" and "Beautiful China."
Chinese and Canadian artists and embassy diplomats performed distinctive cultural and artistic programmes.
It was also the first public appearance for the 16th Chinese ambassador to Canada, Wu Zhixin Congpei.
Cong Peiwu arrived in Canada on 22 September and delivered a copy of the letter of credentials the following day in Ottawa to Canada's Chief Protocol Officer and Chief of Protocol of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, John Wheeler.
Born in May 1967, Cong Peiwu graduated from the Diplomatic Academy.
He was posted to the Chinese Embassy in Canada at the beginning of this century.
Prior to his trip to Canada, he was the head of the North America and Oceania Department of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and had previously served as Minister Counsellor and Minister at the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom.

Speaking on behalf of the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia and the ASEAN Mission, Xiao said the birth of New China in 1949 opened a new era in China's history.
China has made progress from being closed and backward to being open, from being poor in clothing and food to being well off in all respects, and from being poor and weak to being prosperous, rich and strong.
Xiao said that in recent years, China-Indonesia relations have made great strides, with growing political mutual trust, sustained practical cooperation and comprehensive expansion of exchanges in all fields.
China-ASEAN relations have been steadily improving in quality, and have always upheld mutual respect, understanding, trust and support, thus vigorously promoting peace, stability and prosperous development in the region.
Xiao said the fundamental reason for the development of New China in the past 70 years is that the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, have pioneered and developed the road of socialism with Chinese characteristics.
This road conforms to the trends of the times and China's national conditions, profoundly changes the destiny of the Chinese people and the Chinese nation, and contributes greatly to the peaceful development of the world and the region.
The picture shows the theme tour to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

Lang Ping is still dissatisfied with the women's volleyball victory: It will be difficult to beat the strongest team with so many mistakes
The Chinese women's volleyball team hosted the ninth match of the 2019 FIVB Women's Volleyball World Cup in Beijing on the afternoon of 27 February 2019 against the strong Dutch women's volleyball team.

"It's hard to play against a strong team with so many mistakes."
Lang Ping said in an interview after the match.
"We told our players to concentrate, to adjust our attacks if we weren't in position in a pass, and to play defensively with the other team," he said.
Lang Ping also commented on Zhang Changning's performance, saying she encountered some difficulties in the attack, more anxious, too want to hit the ball to death, action will distort.

China's development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat or a challenge.
White Paper: China's development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat or a challenge.
The White Paper points out that China's development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat or a challenge.
As China's combined national strength and international influence grows rapidly, some in the international community fear that China will follow the path of "state supremacy," while others argue for the so-called "China threat doctrine," the paper said.
This is a combination of cognitive misreading, deep-rooted bias, psychological imbalances resulting from power attrition, and deliberate distortions in order to preserve one's vested interests.
It is not only the dream of the Chinese people, but also the common dream of all peoples, to achieve national prosperity, national rejuvenation and people's happiness.
"China's development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat or a challenge."
The White Paper points out that China is the main stabilizer and power source of world economic growth, that China is the largest contributor to world economic growth, that China's scientific and technological innovation has injected new kinetic energy into world economic growth, and that the role of China's economy as a stabilizer and power source will become more prominent in the future.
At present, the world's economic growth momentum is insufficient, and a sound Chinese economy is becoming more and more important to the world.
China's economy is shifting from high-speed growth to high-quality development, with new types of industrialization, informatization, urbanization and agricultural modernization accelerated, the economic structure deeply adjusted, industrial optimization continuously upgraded and new economic growth points emerging.
A study by the McKinsey Global Institute concludes that by 2040, China's integration with the rest of the world economy is expected to generate between $22 trillion and $37 trillion in economic value, equivalent to 15-26 per cent of the global economy, and that stronger cooperation between the rest of the world and China will create enormous economic value.
The paper emphasizes that China's economy and the world economy have undergone structural changes and deep integration.
China, with a more stable economy, a higher quality of growth and a promising growth prospect, is a long-term good for the world economy.
It is neither feasible nor harmful to view China's economic development as a "threat" and a "challenge" and to try to push China out of global industrial chains, supply chains and value chains and decouple it from the world economy.
The White Paper points out that full-scale opening to the outside world creates more opportunities for countries to share the "China dividend."
China is firmly committed to a mutually beneficial and win-win strategy of opening up and achieving greater and higher levels of openness. China has the world's most potential consumer market, is the most attractive investment destination, and more countries will benefit from "going out" on a larger scale.
"Openness should be two-way, mutually beneficial, not one-way, one-sided.
Mutual benefit in both directions can be long-lasting. "
'China is committed to continuously expanding imports, liberalizing market access, improving the business environment and strengthening intellectual property protection, 'the paper said.
Only when all sides side by side can we create an open, inclusive, inclusive, balanced and win-win development environment and jointly make the "cake" of development bigger and bigger, thus forming a mutually beneficial and win-win community of interests.
The White Paper notes that China is providing more public goods to the international community.
This includes promoting high-quality joint construction of the Belt and Road, setting up platforms for multilateral dialogue and cooperation, actively participating in international and regional affairs and actively conducting foreign assistance.
"China has benefited from the international community in its development and has always given back to the international community to provide more and better public goods."
In a recent written interview with Xinhua News Agency, Andrei Slipniov, general manager of Russia's Export Center, said that Russia is ready to strengthen cooperation with China in the economic and trade fields, further optimize its export structure and promote the diversification of Russian exports to China.
He pointed out that forestry, machinery and chemical industries accounted for a large proportion of Russian exports to China, while agricultural exports were also important, including oil products, meat products and dairy products, as well as grains, fish and seafood.
In recent years, Russian exports of non-material and non-energy products to China have also shown good and stable development.
Talking about optimizing the structure of Russia's exports to China, Mr. Slipniov said Russia has set itself the task of expanding its exports of high-tech products to meet the demand for them from countries and regions around the world, including China.
Russia will continue to improve financial and non-financial support measures to promote a further increase in the number of high-tech enterprises.
He said Russia is willing to export construction technology and high-tech building materials to China and to develop cooperation with China in areas such as pharmaceuticals and aerospace manufacturing.
Russia and China also have great potential for cooperation in the field of urban environmental development.
He emphasized that Russia's products in many fields were "qualitatively superior and competitive in price" compared with their Western counterparts.
Turning to the two countries' goal of achieving $200 billion in bilateral trade by 2024, Mr. Slipniov said areas such as agriculture, machinery manufacturing, chemical industry and forestry would play an important role in achieving that goal.
The Russian side is interested in diversifying supply in these areas and promoting exports of deeply processed products.
He stressed that Russia intended to push its exporters into global value-added chains, of which China was one.
Russian manufacturers in the fields of agriculture, metallurgy, oil and gas, and chemicals are well placed to participate in this process.
At present, the two countries need to continue to deepen cooperation between enterprises, "forming more Russian-Chinese joint ventures and jointly developing exports to third countries."
Russian export centers, through the Russian Export Credit and Investment Insurance Agency and the Russian Export-Import Bank, are taking a variety of measures and services to support the export of Russian products to China, Mr. Slipniov said.
Meanwhile, the Russian Export Centre will continue to deepen cooperation with relevant Chinese departments to facilitate easier access of Russian goods to the Chinese market and develop new types of export products to China.

Foreign Ministry's response to Taiwan's so-called "diplomatic breakthrough"
China's foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang responded at a regular press conference to Taiwan's recent entry into United Nations headquarters for a meeting on religious issues, saying the small move was disgraceful and made a mockery of generosity.
According to Taiwanese media reports, officials from Taipei's New York office have recently entered United Nations Headquarters to attend a conference on religious issues in the United States, calling it a "diplomatic breakthrough."
The meeting to which you referred was a side event held by the United States on United Nations premises, not a United Nations meeting at all.
Geng said Taiwanese personnel sneaked into the United Nations to undermine their personality, and described it as a so-called "diplomatic breakthrough," a small move that was disgraceful and demeaning.
He pointed out that the United Nations had repeatedly reaffirmed its adherence to the handling of the Taiwan question in accordance with General Assembly resolution 2758 (XXVI), and that the general membership of the United Nations had also adhered to the one-China principle.

Egyptian authorities are showing a willingness to crack down
Twitter hashtags and social media are advocating for Egyptians to take to the streets today to peacefully demand the removal of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.
However, the authorities have indicated their intention to use force to suppress it.
Since then-military chief Mohamed El-Sisi seized power in a 2013 military coup, dissent has virtually disappeared in Egypt, putting any form of protest at extreme risk.
The Guardian reported that the Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights, a Cairo-based non-governmental organization, said more than 1,900 people had been arrested since last weekend's rare outbreak of protests demanding Mr. Sessi's ouster.
Allegations of corruption surrounding Mr. Sessi and his family's pursuit of vanity by squandering public funds led thousands of people to take to the streets on the 20th.
Yesterday, Egypt's Interior Ministry took a firm position that any attempt to destabilize the country would be met with decisiveness and no soft hand.
Already heavily cordoned off in central Cairo, riot police, security vehicles, and plainclothes police were visible on the streets surrounding Tahrir Square, the site of the 2011 Egyptian revolution.
Al Jazeera reported that security forces on the 25th detained a number of important academics and social sages, including Cairo University political science professor and well-known columnist Nafa.
He tweeted on the 24th: "I have no doubt that the continuation of the absolute rule of Mr. Sessi will be disastrous."
"It is in Egypt's interest that he step down at once."
Hosni, a spokesman for Egypt's former military chief of staff, Annan, was in custody before Nafa's arrest.
Annan was arrested last year after attempting to run against Sessi for the presidency.
The Chairman of the Constitutional Party, Davut, was also detained.
Analysts and politicians argue that, at a time of increasing economic hardship for the poor and middle classes, sweeping the dissent reflects the instability and fragility of government.
"The arrests underscore the regime's disregard for the Egyptian people and its own fears," said opposition leader and former presidential contender Mohamed Nour.
"Because the economy has been messed up by him, coupled with widespread political repression, Sessi is trying to send a clear message to key generals and politicians who might take his place."
In the face of a worsening socio-economic situation, the government's high-handedness will only increase the anger of the people, he said.
Now that the barrier of fear had been breached, he expected more people to take to the streets.
Ali, a former Egyptian military construction contractor and now a businessman and actor in exile in Spain, began uploading a series of videos earlier this month claiming to benefit from government corruption, sparking a wave of small-scale demonstrations in different cities over the weekend.
Ali said his firm, Amrak General Contracting, was able to obtain lucrative contracts without going through a legal tender process, stressing the corruption of the military and of his relatives, including First Lady Intissar Amer al-Sisi.
He was deeply saddened by his involvement.
Ali claimed that his help to the rich palaces and luxury hotels in Seychelles contrasted sharply with the destitute lives of Egyptians today, and that he had not yet been paid.
On Twitter, hashtags such as "Stand Up and You're Not Alone," "Sisi You're Over," "Sisi Get Out," and "Next Friday" have attracted tens of thousands of tweets and retweets calling for people to peacefully take to the streets demanding that Sessi step down.
Hollywood Egyptian actor Ama Wick has nearly 7 million followers on Twitter.
He tweeted yesterday in Arabic: "Seth is doomed... He's done, and his supporters are making a big mistake now."
Free Special Training Scheme for Recently Economically Affected Employees
The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) announced on 27 July that it had launched a free special training programme for employees affected by the recent economic situation. Eligible trainees will receive a training allowance of up to HK $4,000 per month upon completion of the programme.
Many boutiques in the harbour city of Tsim Sha Tsui have few customers.
As a result of the recent social strife in Hong Kong, visitor arrivals have dropped significantly. Apart from the tourism industry, the hotel, catering and retail trades have also been affected.
The Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr K C Lo, and the Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Edward Yau, met with the media on entrusting the Employees Retraining Board with the implementation of special training programmes and measures to support the tourism industry.
Mr Luo said the challenges facing Hong Kong's economy were imminent and that work should not wait for calm.
Therefore, the HKSAR Government has launched a free training programme called "Special Love adds value."
Persons who have been unemployed since June 1 or who have been asked by their employers to take unpaid leave, etc., will have the opportunity to participate in the scheme if they meet the relevant requirements, the spokesman said.

Exercise is tiring, but it's also tiring?
The brain also shows signs of fatigue after strenuous exercise, according to a study of athletes conducted by Russia's satellite network.
The study, led by Mathias Perciglion, an expert at the hospital in Petite-Salpetre in France, showed an inconspicuous link between mental and physical work: Both require cognitive control of activities.
"You need to control the autonomous processes that force you to stop when your muscles and joints are in pain," he explains.
The study was initiated by the French National Institute of Physical Education and Sport.
The school specialists are in charge of preparing the athletes for the Olympic Games.
Some athletes have begun to suffer from over-training syndrome, an uncontrollable sense of fatigue, physical inability to recover and a decline in performance after high-loaded exercise.
INSEP asks the question: Could part of the cause of this condition be nervous fatigue, which is caused by excessive mental effort?
The study is published in the journal Contemporary Biology.

Shipment of "one-stop" two super high-pressure projects
On 26th, Zhendong to South Anhui ± 1100 kV HVDC power transmission project, Sutong 1000 kV AC UHV GIL integrated pipeline project.
Both of these projects occupy high points in the respective fields of transmission technology in the world, and after their commissioning will enable China's large-scale optimization of energy allocation to be greatly enhanced.
Guo Zhi, chief economist of the State Energy Administration, said the Zhendong-Southern Anhui project is the world's largest power transmission capacity and the longest transmission distance.
Its transportation is of great significance to the development of Xinjiang energy base and the supply of electricity in eastern China.
GIL, gas - insulated metal closed transmission lines.
The Sutong Pipeline Corridor Project has set the world record for the highest voltage grade and the highest transmission capacity of the GIL Project.
According to the National Power Grid Company, the transmission distance from Zhendong to southern Anhui Province is 3324 kilometers.
With conventional technology, more than 15% of electricity is lost on the way, and the project has been developed to significantly increase the economic distance to more than 3000 km.
The project will provide 100 million degrees of electricity every 8 hours and 20 minutes, which will help solve the problem of the absorption of new energy in Xinjiang.
According to full-load estimates, the line alone will deliver between 60 and 85 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually, enough to supply more than half of Shanghai's electricity needs throughout the year.
Sutong GIL Comprehensive Pipeline Corridor Project is a controlled project of ultra high voltage AC ring network across the Yangtze River.
A conventional overhead route across the Yangtze River would require the erection of two super-450-metre towers and the construction of a super-four-football-sized artificial island for each tower.

At present, the national power grid has been cumulatively completed "10 crossings 11 straight" ultra-high-voltage project, and "4 crossings 3 straight" is under construction.
Foreign Exchange Bureau: The Structure of China's Foreign Debt Continuously Optimizes the Stability Enhancement of Foreign Debt
"Overall, China's external debt structure is continuously optimized and its stability is enhanced."
Wang Chunying, chief economist and spokesman for the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, said the main indicators of China's foreign debt were within the internationally recognized safety line and the risk of foreign debt was generally manageable.
Wang Chunying in the Foreign Exchange Bureau on the day of the announcement of the end of June 2019 external debt data, in response to reporters' questions made the above-mentioned statement.

White Paper: China's Development Way in Accordance with National Conditions
Beijing, September 27 (C Xinhua) -- China's State Council Press Office released a white paper on China and the World in a New Era on September 27.
The White Paper noted that, over the past 70 years, the Chinese people had made strenuous efforts to explore and advance socialism with Chinese characteristics, successfully pioneered the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics and achieved development achievements that attracted worldwide attention.
The white paper says China's development depends on self-reliance and hard work.
China's development is based on the spirit of "800 million shirts for a Boeing," with generations of people continuously striving and paying hardships and sweats unimaginable to others. It is also based on the spirit of "carrying your own burden," neither in good times nor in bad, not exporting problems, not passing on contradictions, not exploiting other countries by buying and selling them or plundering them. It is also based on the spirit of "feeling the stone and crossing the river," not following the old road of imperialism and colonialism, not copying the development model of Western countries, but combining China's realities, summarizing lessons learned and drawing on human civilization, daring to break out of it and try its own way.
The White Paper said China's development in the interaction with the world, China's development for world peace and development injected positive energy, China's road in line with China's national conditions, adapted to the requirements of the times.
China maintains world peace through practical actions.
For 70 years, China has not initiated any wars or conflicts, nor invaded or occupied an inch of other countries' land.
The White Paper pointed out that the fundamental reason for China's tremendous development success over the past 70 years was that it had found the right path to socialism with Chinese characteristics and had steadfastly followed it.
This is a road that sets out the conditions of our country, puts the interests of the people first, reforms and innovations, seeks common development in openness and governs the country in accordance with the law in an all-round way.
China's size, complex national conditions and difficulties in governing are unprecedented in the world. Without centralized, united and strong leadership, China will be headed for division and disintegration, which will bring disaster to the world.
Over the past 70 years, China has overcome all kinds of risks and challenges, creating one Chinese miracle after another that has attracted world attention, the paper said.
Especially since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, China has made historic achievements in its development and undergone historic changes.The Chinese nation has ushered in a great leap from standing up, becoming rich to becoming strong, and is closer than ever to the great goal of national rejuvenation.
China's development path, with the advance of the times, will increasingly show a bright development prospects.

Taiwanese Businessmen Need to Keep Up with Mainland's Mainstream Industries in Uncertain Age
The 2019 Taiwan Business Forum on Innovative Operational Patterns was held in Taipei on 26 and 27 February.
Many Taiwanese business representatives and academics were invited to share their experiences on enterprise transformation, innovation, succession and market development.
The forum was hosted by the Taipei Institute of Business Administration and co-organized by Group Yin Jinding Securities, Outstanding Mainland Taiwan Businessmen's Association and other organizations.
The two-day conference was divided into the transformation and upgrading modes, business strategies and other seminars, more than 100 participants.
Chen Mingzhang, director of the Taipei Institute of Business Administration, said Taiwanese businessmen faced an "age of uncertainty" as trade frictions between China and the United States persisted.
In his view, Taiwanese businessmen need to keep up with the times and keep up with the mainstream industries developed on the mainland, with a particular focus on innovative products related to science and technology, culture, tourism and health.
"In the past, vendors valued quality, effectiveness and delivery."
Chen Mingzhang believes that Taiwanese merchants only the above - mentioned conditions are not enough at the moment.
He pointed out that Taiwanese-funded enterprises should combine speed and service, speed up the supply chain, and emphasize extension services and life product services.
In addition, "value-added service" is a new area that Taiwanese businessmen can develop vigorously.
Speaking at the session, Xu Wentang, Chairman of Yahui Electronics Co., Ltd., a Taiwanese merchant from Guangdong, said that Yahui Electronics had experienced operational difficulties due to the sudden drop in orders.
Removing the traditional electrical appliance business, transforming vehicle electronic equipment, entering the smart appliance industry, it took three years for the enterprise to achieve revenue.
White Hung-zhang, managing director of Sunshine (Zhuhai) Electronics Co., Ltd., suggested that if it was difficult to develop new customers, it would be better to focus on the original customers to provide "one-stop" services.
Customers switching suppliers involves six factors: Poor service, high price, low quality, slow delivery, low variety and integrity. By addressing these six factors, together with timely modification of production lines and expansion of product categories, enterprises will become irreplaceable suppliers to customers.

According to the Taiwan Economic Daily, Lu Zhengzhang, general manager of the Shanghai-based Golden Earth Company, who operates the center, was awarded the "Outstanding Businessman and Cross-Strait Contribution Award."
Request for Comments on New Regulation: Qualifications Needed for Social Capital to Acquire Rural Land Management Rights
Qualifications are required for social capital to acquire the right to manage rural land
"Administrative Measures on the Transfer of Rural Land Management Rights" for Public Consultation It is proposed to regulate the transfer of social capital, such as business enterprises, to acquire land management rights
Yesterday, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs published on its website a notice for public consultation on the "Administrative Measures on the Transfer of Rural Land Management Rights (Consultation Draft on the Revised Draft)" (hereinafter referred to as the "Consultation Draft"), increasing the supervision and risk prevention of the transfer of social capital, including business enterprises, to acquire land management rights.
The opinion draft is now open for public comment.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, in order to implement the newly amended Law on Rural Land Contracting, further consolidate and improve the rural basic management system, deepen the reform of the rural land system and implement the "separation of powers," the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs has revised the Administrative Measures on the Transfer of the Right to Contract and Operate Rural Land, resulting in the draft Opinions.
Beijing Youth Daily reporters learned that the first publication of the Opinion Draft, there are many important changes.
The newly amended Rural Land Contracting Law clarifies the scope of land transfer and implements the concept of the "separation of three powers," with separate sections on "Land Contracting and Management Rights" and "Land Management Rights," making a clear distinction between the transfer, exchange and transfer of land contracting and management rights (rent, subcontract, shareholding or other forms).
In this Opinion Draft, in order to implement the concept of "separation of three powers," effectively respond to the main thrust of the Law on Rural Land Contracting, and taking into account the fact that the transfer of land management rights and the exchange and transfer of land management rights are quite different in terms of the parties, procedures and supervision, the scope of the transfer was defined, with a focus on the transfer of land management rights, including the forms of transfer, such as leasing and taking shares, and the title of the Regulations was changed from "Administrative Measures for the Transfer of Rural Land Contracting Rights" to "Administrative Measures for the Transfer of Rural Land Management Rights."
The transfer and exchange of land contract management rights shall be governed by separate administrative measures.
The Commentary notes that, in the context of the "separation of powers," farmers are only entitled to a limited term of land management.
Theoretically, even in the event of bankruptcy liquidation, farmers are only at risk of losing their right to operate for a certain period of time. Therefore, it is legally unnecessary and in conflict with the Bankruptcy Law to provide for the return of the contracted land to the original contractor.
Aiming at the problem of preventing farmers from losing land, some methods such as preferred shares, first leased shares and buybacks have been developed in practice.
Considering that preferred shares have been maturely discussed in company law, it is suggested that they should be used as advocacy provisions to prevent the risk of land loss.

You know a place is awesome if the salad dressing is served in a gravy boat! With delicious food and extraordinary service, this Grand Lux at the Venetian is also open 24 hours! Note: the one at the Palazzo does close around 2/3 am..(and why do the connected casinos need 2 Grand Lux's on each end again?)  If a breakfast buffet is what you're craving, this Grand Lux lays out a [[reheat]] display of hot and cold breakfast items + beverage for a reasonable $16.50 (served until 11 weekdays, 12:30 weekends)   Though we were here during brunch hours and both the bf and I love breakfast foods, we wanted a filling lunch. I had the Pasta Carbonara lunch combo, and opted for the fresh organic side salad with ranch dressing IN A GRAVY BOAT! I've always been [[unimpressed]] ordering Pasta Carbonara, afraid the overall taste of the dish will come out too sweet, but Grand Lux did their Pasta Carbonara right! It was [[once]] savory.. but not overly salty, and a hint of sweet from the bacon. I was in [[dearest]] with this ginormous entree!  I've [[perpetually]] heard the Grand Lux described as an upgraded Cheesecake Factory, so I was expecting higher prices. Surprisingly, the sister restaurant chains have comparable, if not identical, pricing schemes.  Service here was top-notch! I don't remember our waitress' name, but she made us feel so comfortable. She came like every 5 minutes, but was the complete opposite from intrusive. She also kept apologizing for the wait (what wait? we didn't even notice that the food was taking longer than usual), and letting us know our food would be out soon. The manager even came to our table on a separate occasion, and apologized more for our food delay.   There are so many great dining options along the Strip, with Grand Lux being one of them. Though realistically, I will not be eating here every time I visit Vegas, this is now one of spots on the top of my list!

To quote my previous review:  "I'm calling this 3.[[89]] Stars, but I'd easily give another star if there was some mango sticky rice available with the boofay for dessert, but I'll admit that's a lot to ask. "  == Well, I didn't get my Mango Sticky Rice, but the Saturday boofay contained a few items not there during weekday lunch, including a wonderful Thai Custard Tart with Apple slices and a seasonally updated version of the fruit salad with tons of ripe mango, strawberry, and pineapple.  The hot line had a few extras as well.  There were more seafood dishes than during the week,  a unique thai 'salsa' with diced green/red peppers and avocado, and a new crispy tofu number I hadn't ever seen before.  I also got to experience the same level of friendly, attentive service I've grown to expect, but from a completely different set of staff.  Consistency like this points to a very [[badly]] run establishment.  So since I promised I'd do it, 4.75 stars!

I have to tell you I've been a fan of Star Trek TNG since i was a kid.  Well, sometime ago i gave a friend of mine some DS9 episodes and i asked him  "hey man, what are you watching lately because I'm done watching all TNG episodes" He said. "Well, i got these episodes of Farscape". I said: "Ok, let me try it" I was pretty sure at that time that i wont like it because i was just finised watching TNG and found it [[gargantuan]]."  I had 3 episodes, viewed those but the show didn't impressed me very much, i found it childish initially and i thought its just another TV show, nice adventures but regular. Music was a little bit different, neat special effects though and i had the vague impression that the actors didn't fully get into the characters skin.  I watched another 3 episodes thinking that 3 eps were not enough to decide i like or not since. Then the [[showcases]] started to get me, i got a good grasp of the action and wanted to see what happened next to the poor Crichton....the rest is history.   I think i mostly like the [[libre]] of the [[personages]] in the context of the action unlike Star Trek where everybody slept when they were supposed to do and way too much high tech bullshit.   The show got better with each episode, very interesting story line.....what can i say, this movie its like poetry.   I highly recommend it!!!

First and foremost I wish to aim a big & mean middle-finger towards the Troma DVD-distribution crew, who were actually stupid enough to reveal the identity of this movie's pivot killer on the back of the cover! The synopsis just randomly mentions who's the person responsible for the massacre on graduation day, for Christ's sake! I don't care how terrible or how predictable an 80's slasher can be; just mentioning who did it [[tatters]] the whole point! So, a word of advise in case you also purchase the Troma double-feature containing "Graduation Day" and "Nymphoid Barbarian in Dinosaur Hell", do not   repeat DO NOT   turn the box around and read the back! [[See]] the film is already a painful experience, but reading the back would really spoil everything.  Now, as for the actual the actual movie  Oh boy! Personally I'm a fan of the cinematic 'work' of Herb Freed. Well actually, I don't really know whether I should admire him or pity him! All Herb's [[theatres]] are pretty [[negative]] & [[untrained]], but at the same time you can [[speaking]] his direction is spirited and full of good [[wish]]! Unlike with "Haunts" and "Beyond Evil", he followed a contemporary popular genre trend and tried to cash in on the typical high-school slasher films. Just to offer a minimum of originality, all the victims in "Graduation Day" are promising athletes and members of the same track of coach George Michaels (awesome name! I guess Herb Freed is a fan of "Wham!"). During the opening credits, we witness how a young girl dramatically dies on the field, moments after winning a 30 seconds running race. The debate of whether or not her coach and fellow track team-members weren't pushing her physical limits too much is raised, but one particular individual goes one step further and begins to sadistically kill everyone he/she considers responsible for Laura's death. What a demented little movie! The script must be one of the most incoherent ones I ever beheld, with loads of red herrings and sub plots that go absolutely nowhere and death sequences that are almost too cheesy for words! There's a bloke impaled by a football attached to a javelin, others are decapitated with an absurdly big sword and the unluckiest bastard of them all even falls to his death on a disguised bed of spikes! Herb concentrates on the ingeniousness & the fast pacing of the killings so much that he totally forgets about the sub plots he introduced earlier in the film! For example, Laura's sister returns home from her military training and seemly starts an investigation regarding the circumstances of her death. Halfway through the movie, however, her character hardly appears in the movie anymore. Also, the girls' stepfather is referred to as a violent drunkard but this interesting given immediately gets ignored as well. Instead of carefully mounted suspense and misleading red herrings, we're served disco-dancing & roller-skating sequences and   of course   numerous images of unattractive 80's chicks stripping their tops off. Despite being really bad, "Graduation Day" could count on a respectable cast! Christopher George ("Grizzly", "City of the Living Dead") greatly stars as the demanding coach, Carmen Argenziano ("When a Stranger Calls", "The Accused") briefly appears as a police detective investigating the rising number of missing teenagers and Michael Pataki ("Dead & Buried", "Dracula's Dog") has a very amusing part as the school's stressed out principal. The teenage beauties on duty include Linnea Quigley and Vanna White. Heck, for some horror fans, the presence of these two ladies is enough reason already to count "Graduation Day" among the most quintessential slashers of the early 80's. It's a dumb film, but entertainment and chuckles are guaranteed!

[[Giorgio]] [[Cross]] proved that she could really dance up a storm in this [[2424]] charmer about the ultimate sacrifice that her sister ([[Sergio]] [[Heard]]) makes for her.  When both sisters come to New York, they follow Blondell's beau, a wonderful George Murphy, in this film.   As fate would have it, the director of the show is impressed with Turner but sees nothing ahead for Blondell except a job as the cigarette-girl. Not only does Blondell miss stardom, boyfriend, Murphy ([[Mcgee]]) falls for Turner as well. So as not to hurt her sister, Turner is ready to marry the producer of the show, a wealthy womanizer who has wed 4 times.  The story concludes as best as possible with Blondell taking a fast exit back to Nebraska. Look for [[Layne]] [[Mathers]], as a gossip columnist in the film. He is hard to recognize due to the date of the film and the fact that he is much thinner. The film leaves you with the question of whether Ford and Blondell could ever get together.  [[Kadence]], as the devoted sister, sacrifices both career and love, for her sister. This film is sentimental and might have worked better if it had been shot in Technicolor.  Few realize that George Murphy, the future Republican senator from California, was quite a song and dance man in his day.

I've had bad luck with the Deli at this Basha's. two time this year I've ordered a pizza and when I come to pick it up there is [[NOS]] pizza!  1st time my [[fin]] slip was found on the [[porch]] and then [[introduced]] in to the [[wreckage]]. Today's order, well the deli personnel [[lois]] like I never called it in. I ordered a sausage with extra cheese and spelled out my name, because its unusual. They apologized and offered to make me another one, it'd take 15min. Well I've already [[contemplated]] 30min!  I [[forgot]] to [[disappear]] to [[SPROUTED]] to buy a frozen pizza. Basha's pizza is ok. I get it because I believe in shopping local. I live in Verrado and I want to [[supporting]] local businesses. It's a WIN WIN [[occasion]]. I called and spoke to the manager, Tiffany. She apologized and offered me a free pizza next time. I told her she needs to look at the deli personnel and re-evaluate their procedures for taking orders. She even told me when I call to ask for the manager and place my order with them. A manager has time to take pizza orders??? It's one thing to own up to a mistake BUT totally something else to tell the customer they never order in the first place. Now we call the customer a liar!  I believe I'm done with Basha's.
The undoubted highlight of this [[travesty]] is Peter O'Toole's performance. In turn wildly comical and terribly terribly tragic. Does anybody do it better than O'Toole? I don't think so. What a great face that man has!  The story is an odd one and quite disturbing and emotionally intense in parts (especially toward the end) but it is also oddly touching and does succeed on many levels. However, I felt the film basically revolved around Peter O'Toole's luminous performance and I'm sure I wouldn't have enjoyed it even half as much if he hadn't been in it.

Watchers is a fun [[cinematographers]] if it's not taken too seriously, the novel written by Dean R. Koontz is obviously a lot better but the movie itself is entertaining in it's own way. The film has a lot of changes for the novel Watchers, the one difference is the main character Travis. In the book he was an adult and an retired Delta Force soldier while in the film he's a teenager. Watchers has it's good points, the film does have some gory scenes in parts. I'm a fan of Micheal Ironside and it was cool to see him in this film, he always does a great performance in all his films. The OXCOM costume looks kind of cheesy but the camera never really shows the creature fully until near the end of the film. The dog Einstien was impressive since it was well trained.  The film sees two genetic experiments escaping from a lab, a dog and a monster. Both experiments are linked telepathically since the two animals are part of a military project were the dog would infiltrate an enemy base then the Creature would attack and eliminate them. The Dog finds a teenager named Travis who takes him home and discovers that he's intelligent and so he names the dog Einstein, meanwhile the OXCOM is roaming around killing people and gouging out their eyes, two Government agents are sent to find the two experiments before this incident gets out of hand. Soon Travis learns that his not safe as the OXCOM is drawn to the dog and will stop at nothing to kill him and anyone in it's way, so Travis and his mom go to rescue his girlfriend who's being held at the hospital by the two agents. They then hideout in the woods while the Government agents and the OXCOM are not far behind.  Watchers is not a great adaptation of Dean R. Koontz novel but it is a entraining 80's horror flick, some fans of the book may not want to watch this since it's not faithful to the book but fans of cheesy 80's horror movies may want to check this out.

[[Johnmark]] blows all the female cast members out of the water, including the official love interest [[Madaline]] Moreau.  I would have loved to see this movie play out as Akasha's power trip. Aaliyah is simply electrifying whenever she is on the screen. She does sensual, beautiful and menacing to the power of [[2]]. Watching her take on a bar full of vampires is a sight to behold.  [[Draven]] Olin is cast in the ungrateful role of "the older woman", which is hugely unjustified. She looks fantastic and at 46 (according to the IMDb) still looks stunning.  The story unfortunately is very limited plot wise, we've seen it all before, etc.  The most heart wrenching is Akasha's death scene, especially keeping in mind what happened to Aaliyah after filming.  All in all, a remarkable vampire movie.

I really like Terrace, and I like that they are locally owned and operated. While I cut my teeth at the Piedmont Row location, I found this Ballantyne restaurant to be fulfilling as well.  The space was once something else...and I ate there once. It [[was]] [[not]] very memorable. So I was super excited to see that [[Dorien]] was moving in.   Having been for dinner ([[1]] stars), I direct my attention to their extensive breakfast and brunch offerings ([[2]] stars). I have had several menu items here, but the standouts are:  * Oatmeal (so, so good) * Omelette with tomato, spinach and mozz (if they feel like letting me have mozz that day, since it's not on the omelette menu) * RED VELVET WAFFLE (not for the faint of heart. quite sweet.) * Blueberry pancakes   I appreciate that they're trying to do the dinner thing, but it's just not happening. I'd recommend going for breakfast/lunch (they serve breakfast every day until 2:[[50]]).   I'm getting hungry... Who wants to meet me for lunch?

Okay, I want to [[fascinate]] it more than I do but.....well, lets just dig into the review. First, know that I went there for lunch on a Saturday, not in the evening when it is in full swing, so maybe I missed part of the ambiance but honestly, I went there to try the food.   First, I had the olives appetizer and based just on that, this place would be amazing. It was a small plate full of big, meaty, green olives, obviously warmed in a bath of live oil and served with a light sprinkle of salt and oh, so good. I would go back just for these. But, an appetizer does not a meal make so lets go on to the main course and side dish.   For lunch I had some sort of pasta which was advertised to have anchovies, lemon, and if i remember correctly, hot pepper. I also ordered a side of braised greens. The pasta, when it was served, came in a large white bowl and honestly, when I order a pasta dish over $10, I prefer it to be well...plated, on a plate. The dish also contained sauteed fennel which, while not unpleasant, was not expected, and it seemed, it was a bit dry. As for the braised greens, also served in a large white bowl and that was it, just the braised greens. Some cracked black pepper and some shaving of hard cheese, would definitely have helped round out the side dish (though at $3 I can't complain too much but make it $4 and bump it up a bit).   Finally, the decor, nothing really stands out. Sen, right next door, has much more of an artistic edge so maybe they could kick up the look of the place a bit. So, take the review for what it is and if nothing else, go in the evening for a glass of wine and the olive appetizer (a steal at $5) but overall, it did not wow me as much as I expected from all the write-ups.

I grew up in the area, and was a fan of Lucky Boy, and then it changed owners, and the quality sucked, so I retired its jersey.  After reading here on Yelp that Lucky Boy was back to its full glory, I had to see for myself. I hit the drive thru on a Thursday afternoon, and the service was quick, friendly, and efficient.   Getting the burger with 1,000 island dressing, and side of fries, I went home. I was very happy to learn that the burgers were better than [[not]]! Tasty [[burger]], with a nice char taste, and they pay attention to details, which is great. Tasty fresh lettuce, tomatoes, onions, piled on a grilled bun makes for a great meal.   Lucky Boy v1.0 had kind of weak fries, they were trying to be fresh and simple, but they were bland and tasteless. Lucky Boy v2.0 uses frozen fries, and does a great job of cooking them perfectly.  Just an FYI, the inside of Lucky Boy is very, very small. Cute, but small, so if you have a large group, this may be a better take out spot.  I also had a strawberry malt, which was very [[decent]].  I look forward to putting Lucky Boy back in the rotation. I think it's really cool to have really good food, locally owned at good prices. I know the 5 Guys Vs. In-N-Out war rages on, but I will stick with Lucky Boy!

The [[larder]] could be the most [[wicked]] run I've ever seen.  I've been here three times.  The first time was when it first [[aperture]] four years [[lately]] - the food was pretty good.  Second time was awful - too much time passed between courses and the [[restaurants]] came out [[frozen]].  As I live close by, I decided to try one more time to see which experience was the accurate representation.  Unfortunately, my LAST experience there matched my second and I really took notice this time of how frazzled the service staff was as a result of the kitchen's poor coordination.    As my wife and I sat at the bar for over a half hour later than our original reservation time, we engaged in conversation with others dining at the bar; I've never seen so many people send back cold food.

I was quite [[overwhelmed]] when I saw this film in competition at the Montreal Film Festival. [[pleased]] with Elephant and a few others, I thought the issue of American gun violence/culture would be treated intelligently and in a fashion compelling for [[anyone]]. The press-release promised (in not so many words) a `Red Violin' for the gun-violence crowd, something to [[lets]] us ponder our [[present]] mindset in this country.  After waiting until after 9:15 to be seated for a 9AM screening (what technical difficulties they would have encountered is beyond me), we were finally let into the venue to [[release]] the film on DV (where did the advertised 35MM print [[end]]?). I think I just answered my first question.  The result is an abhorrent [[deal]]. We get the "gun", in a vignette with the most unrealistic "biker' I have ever seen (and I do know more than a few). The film then lapses into irrelevant "character development" only because the [[character]] are either a. stereotyped, b. losers, c. stereotyped losers, and/or d. racial caricatures. It takes another 30 [[min]] to get to the plot movement, and once we are there, we wish for the inane conversations between the couples and/or the bikers and pawn brokers.  The film finds it's conclusion, but not without leaving any cliché untried. I didn't care for the white-trash characters who came in contact with the gun, and the depiction of the minority characters should have the NAACP crying foul immediately. All these people WOULD chase after a gun, because they are at the bottom of the societal trash-heap, and would look for an opportunity wherever it was found. Placing the action a level up would have at least provided some soul-searching on the part of the characters.  The biggest problem is the promise unfulfilled. The plot outline was great. In the hands of a P.T. Anderson or Gus Van Zandt, it could have been a powerful piece. But due either to bad screenplay, direction or both, the thing is an unmitigated mess that needs to be ignored at all costs.  My bigger question is who at the MFF thought this was competition material. Better bury this on Showtime at 3AM.  Art Blose

The year 2004 was the year of the biopic with no less than four pictures tackling real events, real people, with varying degrees of critical praise. Of the four pictures to make it to the race to the Oscars in early 2005 (KINSEY, THE AVIATOR, HOTEL RWANDA, and, RAY), RAY became the big winner of the night as the acting award went to Jamie Foxx for his portrayal of R & B genius Ray Charles.  And it was well-deserved despite that Leonardo diCaprio came close and Liam Neeson wasn't even nominated. What made Foxx the winner was that the other two were playing relatively obscure eccentrics, Ray Charles was still making music right up until his death in 2004 and by then there wasn't a soul who didn't know at least one song that Charles' had penned. It did help that Jamie Foxx rose well above the movie -- itself as a whole somewhat weak and often looking like it wouldn't be out of place as a TV biopic -- and his portrayal is detailed as it's [[brutish]]. He has the delicate assignment which is to embody a person down to nuances, and once the crisis of Ray's addiction to heroin hits a head, Foxx pulls out all the stops and it isn't hard to imagine the real Ray actually going through such a painful ordeal.  The low point of the film is how it spends a little too much time in detailing Ray's relationship with women. Like THE AVIATOR, Taylor Hackford wishes to establish that Ray had this turbulent life, a product of his own demons and his entry into success at a time when being black and successful brought a huge amount of baggage. Of the women, the only one to succeed bringing real life is Sharen Warren as Ray's mother. Hers is a difficult role since she is alone on screen with the child actor playing young Ray but her facial and body language is gut-wrenching, especially at the moment she must relinquish her maternity to have Ray find his way around the house. Such intensity of emotion, to stand there and watch your blind son crawl across a room and having to force him to have this rude awakening into independence. A beautiful performance, and one which should have been acknowledged.  A fantastic counterpoint to RAY is the featured music. Anyone who knows R & B will enjoy the early recordings of Ray's radio hits as much as his later ones which would bring him to the forefront of popular music, and Jamie Foxx virtually steals the show as he performs the songs as Ray. That alone will live on even when the movie in itself is little more than a stiff biopic. I would have, though, loved it if they would have used his last Adult Contemporary hit from 1993, "Sing my Song for You" in the closing credits. After all, it is Ray Charles, a performer who had a fierce dedication to his art.
A [[terribly]] well-managed apartment complex. The apartments themselves are very nice (get a second story apartment with [[skyrocketed]] ceilings, if you can).

On balance, it's a great place to live!

The [[glisten]] of this story delivers at least one skillfully crafted message to each viewer in the audience. This story is about success, it's about failure. It's about the choices you make in life and the choices others make for you. The story deals with self realization and determination on a scale so large, no camera angle could cover it. Within the grasp of each scene is resides an element marked for depiction within your imagination. Keep this in mind as you watch the movie; it's more than eye candy. The sexually suggestive, rarely explicit scenes serve only to distract and entertain you during the tedious process of character development.
I finally saw LAURE and I [[got]] to say that I equally [[liked]] it and was dismayed by it. What's great about it is the atmosphere, the music, the location, the cinematography and the beautiful cast. The story is non-existent for sure but with these movies it doesn't really matter. The pace in languid and the settings are exotic. The film has a lot going for it. Unfortunately, it also has a few things going against it. The first thing is that the gorgeous Annie Belle and the handsome Al Cliver have no chemistry whatsoever. Because the two are playing a couple and are on screen for almost the entire length of the film the lack of chemistry between the two is a definite liability. According to IMDb, Al and Annie were a real couple when they filmed this movie. They sure kept their attraction to each other from showing on screen.  The other problem with LAURE is that some sex scenes are just ineffective or even ridiculous. There's one sex scene that stands out as one of the silliest I've ever seen in any soft porn flick: our young blonde couple are picked-up by a helicopter pilot who happens to be a cross-dresser! The pilot flies over the city to pick up his girlfriend (!) and they have an orgy of sorts in the helicopter, in mid-air. And Al Cliver is filming all of this with his 16mm camera! I kid you not. Ridiculous. We later see that 16mm footage being edited on a moviola. While the footage rolls, Al and Annie start making out. This scene is actually good but the footage on the screen behind them was at times too much. Watching the footage of the cross-dresser getting it on with his bimbo while piloting the helicopter almost had me rolling on the floor laughing out loud. Is this supposed to be erotic or believable in any way? The last thing I want to see is a woman pleasuring a man in drag, certainly when the man in drag makes for such an ugly woman, while piloting a helicopter, no less. Al and Annie getting it on was cool as was the music during the entire scene. I just wish the footage on the editing screen wasn't so silly.  Speaking of drag, another dull plot point in LAURE which really drags the movie to a crawl are all those moments with the great Orso Maria Guerrini and his two wives. A married threesome is an interesting idea but it hardly registers here as hot or even interesting. The two women are sorta dull and we rarely see the three having sex. In fact, Orso keeps his clothes on for almost the entire film, even when he's with Annie Belle. This is another minor complaint about LAURE: there's nudity but it's not as much as other films of the same era. It just needed more skin to punch it up.  Except for those minor complaints and the drag queen moments, LAURE is actually very watchable. I love these kind of softcore films from the 1970s when the attention was set on mood and atmosphere, not the crude stuff we see today.  p.s.: make sure to watch Emanuelle in Egypt, which stars Annie & Al but also another famous screen couple, Laura Gemser and Gabriele Tinti. The music in that movie is also great.

We went to our first show at the Orpheum Theatre last night.  [[me]] thought the theater was absolutely beautiful. I loved the intricate [[structurally]]. It felt old but stately. It's got tons of character and I found myself taking pictures everywhere. The sound was wonderful as well.    We saw Jake Shimabukuro, ukulele virtuoso, there. It was a perfect venue for him. So [[wondrous]], stately, quiet with great acoustics. It really highlighted his performance.  I found out it was built from 1927-1929 in Spanish Midieval and Baroque styles. After a while, it was turned into a movie theater and remained that for years and years. They painted the murals and moldings black during the movie era. In the late 80s they started a renovation on it which was completed in 1997. They brought back much of the original design (moldings, murals, etc.)  Now it's just [[wondrous]]. Anytime I see something interesting playing there, the theatre itself will definitely add to the draw. Can't [[hopes]] to head back!
Last night, I attended a screening of Badland with my cousin. We were kind of excited to learn once we got there that the director/writer, the producer (his wife), and several cast members were also in attendance and that there would be a discussion and Q&A after the movie. But once the movie was over and the credits started rolling (and the film really was not edited well enough and is too long), my cousin and I, without [[councilman]] each other, immediately got up and left. We found out once we started talking outside that we were both feeling so angry that not only did we not want to stay for the discussion, we couldn't even look at the cast and crew who had been standing near the exit and who we walked right by as we left.  I have figured out that the roots of my anger were planted during the scene in which Jerry slices his daughter Celina's palm with a big knife so that her blood could be used to leave a fake trail. It was unavoidable to connect in my mind the physical pain he inflicted on her body with the emotional pain he inflicted on her spirit by murdering her mother and two brothers in her presence, sparing her, and taking her with him when he fled. I've sliced my palm before (accidentally); even a fairly superficial cut is incredibly painful because the palm is so sensitive, and it is very slow to heal if you don't keep it immobile because you just keep opening it up trying to go about your life. But after a very short time with only a narrow strip of cloth tied clumsily around her palm and one scene with a big band-aid, it was as if she'd never been cut. My anger reached its peak--I won't spoil this moment for you--in Celina's final scene.  I got angry because Celina is by far the most sympathetic character in the film (the actress portraying her is a good one); I was and you can't tell me a good screenwriter wouldn't know this immersed in feeling both her physical and emotional pain; and the screenwriter, by treating Celina's emotional pain so cavalierly and with such disrespect, also treated me, the audience member, cavalierly and with utter disrespect.  Sure, the script has moments of tears for Celina, and some dialogue that tells us she's hurting, somewhere, somehow. But by this time, we the audience are feeling so manipulated that we've shut down. The manipulation starts very early on in this movie, when Jerry's family's dialogue spells out for the audience that Jerry had psychiatric problems. Rule one, screenwriters: give your audience some credit. Let them do a good bit of the creative work on their own. Tell the story; don't explain to us everything we're supposed to think and feel. We don't like it.  My cousin also knew she was having trouble with the movie early on, dialogue-wise, when Jerry and his wife had little to say to each other besides fuck this, fuck that, fuck you. Some couples do indeed find themselves in relationships so bad that the f-bomb ends up being every other word out of their mouths. But it's like watching comedians who curse a lot. Some of them are really funny; the cursing is ancillary. But some of them substitute cursing for humor, and this screenwriter, to carry the metaphor to its conclusion, is no Chris Rock.  This husband and wife team bravely chose to tackle an awfully complex story with awfully complex characters. But they seem not to have realized that the meaning of a story, especially a complex one, will vary for each member of the audience. Successful storytelling requires paying attention to important factual details, not working desperately to interpret the meaning of the story for the whole audience.  I worked with Vietnam veterans for five years, I've heard more stories than most, and I'm always happy to see films released that bring their stories to a broader audience. It's important, on all kinds of different levels, that we hear them. But I am less than thrilled that this storyteller decided before the film even began what Jerry's story meant and proceeded to spell it out for us with a very heavy hand. Next time, pay more attention to the details.

I [[grasp]] the draw and appeal to such a different [[nature]] of [[filmmaking]] and I am a huge [[amateurs]] of [[theaters]] with little dialog but all the same this one absolutely [[scary]]. I've been to the Scottish highlands and found the lack of Scottish accents in the characters [[somber]]. This plot was strong enough in [[theories]] but the cheap sets and lack of a single realistic character [[conserve]] this film from getting off the ground. I feel the use of silence to create atmosphere only works when you have actors who can exude some sort of presence without speaking and these actors certainly cant. If you want a silent movie that captures that presence try (Le Dernier Combat). There have been very few movies that I couldn't even manage to finish and this was one of them. Absolute dribble!

History and experience over the past couple of decades has shown us that intellectuals talking about sex is about the unsexiest and unintellectual thing anyone can do, but this wasn't quite as obvious back in 1986. Basically, the idea in this film is that these characters insatiable drive to find comfort, security, and pleasure in sexual acts is actually the unhealthy motive that makes them so unbearable to themselves--which they hide from themselves with more sex. This drive is linked to "the decline of the American Empire", as expressed in an early interview within the movie.  So the idea is that relatively detestable people talk about sex, and that that talk is supposed to reveal how detestable they are as people. Arcand at least keeps giving it drive and momentum by doing interesting things with the camera such as isolating most of the characters in single frames, revealing their ultimate loneliness, and cutting rapidly between them, showing how they are more at war with each other than they are at agreement. And to [[donner]] Arcand credit, this is pretty much what intellectual life is, a constant struggle with other intellectuals to stand out, even when everyone knows that standing out means standing alone.  But yeah, the characters and action are unsexy and kind of pathetic. I think this film is much more an aspect of its time than it is something meant to last, which makes it kind of dated. It's also the exact type of mental buffing in dialog and references to people like Susan Sontag that makes art-house films so unpopular around the populist entertainment moviegoers. In all, I'll take it anyway--it has its place basically among the exact type of people the characters are--it's just that it's not really interesting or important to anyone who isn't those characters.  --PolarisDiB

Ri Ra located inside Mandalay Place looks just like any store-front restaurant you'd find in a mall.  However walk-in and you will discover several rooms with Irish decor and you'll begin to see just how [[prodigious]] this [[mise]] really is!  [[me]] was [[splits]] between many [[issue]] on the menu [[than]] they had simple food with little "[[rotates]]" thrown in.  I decided on a meatloaf burger made with veal, topped with mashed potatoes, onion rings and a Guinness ketchup.  Before I get to the burger, we also split some potato cakes, very crispy on the outside with a balsamic dressing, but [[pliable]] on the inside.  The burger was different but very [[ravishing]] packed with flavor (most likely to all the toppings going on!) and it left me very [[complied]] throughout the day.  Two other people at the table had a huge piece of fish and chips and I stole a bite or two of the soft cod.  Overall I would come here again, especially on Friday's where [[townspeople]] get 40% offuck  I am looking forward to trying all the other menu items (my own Fish & Chips, Guniess burger and Shepards Pie come to mind!)

There were at least a half dozen silent-film versions of Shakespeare's "The Merchant of Venice," and there have been several television productions. But no one has ever gotten around to making a big-budget theatrical feature from the play . . . until now. Given the nature of the play/s most memorable character, Shylock the Nasty Jew, it's a good guess that the little [[annoyance]] that transpired in Europe in the late 1930's and 1940's may have dampened filmmakers' [[passion]]. Sure the main motivation for Michael Radford's new film is to provide Al Pacino with a chance to shout, bray, brood, mutter, and be tormented - all of which he is quite good at. Like Richard III, the role of Shylock is a scenery-chewer's dream. It is ridiculous to call Shakespeare an anti-Semite, since he never met a Jew. Jews were banned from England from 300 years before his time to some decades after his death; and its unlikely that he ever traveled abroad. On some level, Jews might as well have been a mythological race to him. But, while Shakespeare may not have been anti-Semitic, his play certainly is. Pacino gives Shylock a strange accent that is probably meant to suggest the slightest hint of Yiddish. Unfortunately, the result is a 16th-century moneylender with the unmistakable diction and cadences of Fozzie Bear. Radford's version begins with a crawl about the wretched teratment of Jews and then spot Antonio (Jeremy Irons) gratuitiously spitting on Shylock (Pacino), who's really just standing around, minding his own business. Will buy it when it comes out on DVD, for sure! Sarge Booker

[[Frustrated]] in here for lunch with my mom after visiting the Museum.  I was curious to try this place since it received a good review from Howard Seftel in the AZ Republic.  It's basically cafeteria style and you can order several interesting choices.  I noticed that a lot of their produce is organic and grown locally.  I had the Global which if memory serves me correctly, was a braised beef shank.  It was served with a salad of super fresh ingredients including purple beets.  Definitely try to stop in for lunch.  They are only open 11AM to 2 PM.
This is an action packed film that makes me feel very peaceful and relaxed every time I see it. The film (short of its conclusion) demonstrates that in the face of extreme odds, it is still possible to prevail.  This [[travesty]] is very refreshing, and likely to be banned at any moment. Get a copy of it before the thought police burn every copy they can find. They don't want you to have hope for the future, or to think you have a chance.  On the other hand, should Political Correctness fail to supress it, this would be an excellent movie to release on DVD. Such a release could contain interviews with the writer and director, and related goodies. I'm sure it would sell some copies, and I would be one of the first to buy it.  - Mincka

The St. Francisville Experiment claims "this ain't no walk in the woods", a direct slap in the face of Blair Witch. Where Blair Witch proved to be a film that [[overwhelmed]] the viewer's imagination through simple suggestion, The St. Francisville Experiement overworks the viewer's patience. One must say, however, that this is destined to be a camp classic.  Warning: Spoiler is forthcoming!!  I viewed this movie in a local theater in which the movie's "paranormal consultant" Troy Taylor spoke about the making of the movie. Should anyone want to see this movie without knowing the forthcoming information, stop reading here. For those of you who can't resist, read on my friends and all shall be told.  Mr. Taylor, a writer of rather unintriguing ghost stories which he claims are all true, informed the audience at this video screening that The St. Francisville Experiment was not a documentary. Shock! Amazing! As if we didn't know... He informed us that all of the frightening discoveries the participants made were all staged and [[preordained]] by the film's producers. Matter of fact, he informed us that the last 15 minutes were not even filmed in Louisiana, but rather in California. All four participants were true actors (notice I didn't say good...). One of the participants is actually a special effects technician on ER.  What infuriates me about this film is that it proclaims everything is true. It feebly attempts to outdo The Blair Witch Project by claiming it's true whereas Blair Witch was a hoax. The amazing thing is that no one could have belief this film for an instant. Filled with dreadful acting and hilarious lines such as "surround yourself with the white light" and "I love the ghosts", The St. Francisville Experiment belongs at midnight movies everywhere so the crowd can properly heckle, boo, jeer and chant "I love the ghosts!"  Talk about false advertising. True stories are not filmed with staged special effects that look as if the neighborhood Boy Scouts troop set up a haunted house. From the bug in the sandwich (ooh...scary...) to the annoying Madison, from the "seance" which is nothing more than the foursome playing on an Oujia Board to the two mice being found under a bed, The St. Francisville Experiement is one embarrassing hoax of a movie. Lion's Gate would be wise to dump this thing into the nearest trash compactor or advertise it as it really should be:  "The St. Francisville Experiment: A comedic look at how not to make a movie".
It's been a long time since such an original, quite funny, [[disgraceful]] comedy has surfaced. If "Eating Raoul" is on your top 100 list, do yourself a favor and find "Undertaking Betty" immediately. The subject of death being funny has been attempted before (see Paul Bartel and Mary Woronov in "Mortuary Academy"). While that movie has some brilliant moments of black comedy, "Undertaking Betty" is much more [[inveterate]], with a better cast. Who could imagine that the undertaking business might be fertile ground for an original, uplifting, and heartfelt comedy? I was surprised and you will be too. I highly recommend seeing "Undertaking Betty" - MERK

I've never really enjoyed [[restaurant]], but my wife wanted to come here for her birthday. I never really felt like I could get a good meal at a buffet but I was wrong.   The sushi was [[admittedly]] good. They had at least 10 different rolls and not just the basic rolls but stuff like Rainbow rolls and the likes. Tried them all and they were all very good. They had one sushi chief just throwing out rolls cause the sushi was going fast. They also had tempura which included lots of vegetables plus shrimp.   They had a meat bar with prime rib, Chinese BBQ ribs, & sausage. The ribs are really good. Nice and sweet. You have to try these ribs.The sausage is ok and didn't try the prime rib but looked good. Lots of good Chinese food with lots of seafood in it and I enjoyed it. There was also a cold bar with salads and fresh fruit. Lastly, they have a pretty good desert bar where they have a server scoop out the ice cream.   So overall, they have lots of selections of different kinds of food but most [[indispensable]] it's all [[charges]]. You could tell that none of the dishes have been sitting out there for a long time. Very [[sweet]] and hot.   Service was good. Picking up our dirty dishes and filling up our water glasses in a timely manner. All I can say is that the food is really good, lots of variety to satisfy everybody, but the best part is that if you Check-in you get a 20% off your bill.   Enjoy and have a really good meal.

I was able to see "[[anytime]] But Here" last night as a free sneak preview. I [[even]] LOVED the film! [[he]] was drawn to it because of the realistic [[portrayed]] of a mother/daughter [[ratio]]...there was [[apparently]] a connection between Adele a and Ann. [[myself]] [[maybe]] that speaks volumes of the outstanding performances of both Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman. [[i]] was just the right actress to portray Adele and after [[entering]] the theater I could not [[make]] of another actress in the role. Portman was also [[popular]] as Ann. She brought a sense of maturity and intelligence to the role that I don't [[guarantee]] any other teenage actress could. I think it [[decided]] the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and [[science]] should [[make]] credit where it is due and nominate both Sarandon and [[amy]] for Awards in the "Actress" and "Supporting Actress" [[section]]. It would be a shame if they were [[finalists]].
Two page boys working at a radio network go from trying to solve murders to performing in black-face in between work shifts. Jack Moran and Sidney Miller star in this whodunnit from 1945. Lots of fast talking, everybody yells at everybody, and the two page boys call the police detective "Marty" (played by Ralph Sanford). It's a [[worthy]] "shortie" at 59 minutes, and it has the feel of being adapted from a play, since it mostly takes place in a radio station soundstage. We don't really care about any of the characters, which is probably why its hardly ever shown. No big deal. This was Phil Karlson's second film as director. We're not given any clues as to who might be knocking people off, so we just kind of follow the police detective and the page boys as they all try to solve the mystery first. I'll say no more so as not to give away any spoilers.

I saw this one at Sundance, and I can't figure out why it won the [[leads]] award. It was [[terrifically]] [[lent]] and [[scarcely]] colorless. It's the type of movie that is only appreciated by film fest snobs who think any [[films]] that a lot of people like must be beneath them.  The jury at [[Premiered]] this year seemed to be making a conscious effort to [[distinctions]] the underdog, ultra-low-budget films. That's all [[quite]] and [[optimum]], but this [[roaming]], [[tow]] mess looks [[adore]] a home [[theatre]]. Mini-DV [[murdered]] in a snow-covered gray winter results in a drab look for a drab movie.  Certain motifs (snakes) are beaten to death in spite of the fact that they add nothing to the story and make no sense as symbols.  Now, it wasn't all bad. Vera Farmiga is phenomenal in her role as a mother with a drug problem. She will be going places, and she deserves it. Her co-star Hugh Dillon also does a fine job. Frankly, there are many fine moments in this movie, but they just don't fit together very well.

We spent a week in this family friendly time share hotel, got the 2 bedroom "villa" compliments of my sis.  I was pleasantly surprised at how well thought out this place is.  With a full kitchen, washer and dryer, I totally overpacked since my mama was doing laundry everyday for some reason.  The rooftop pool is a nice touch but it's a bit small for so many people.  And the smoking area by the tiny "rooftop bar" is a bit disturbing especially considering most kids hang out by the pool.  The mandatory complimentary valet is a bit frustrating as well.  But besides from that, this is a [[terrible]] place to stay.  We had 3 LCD TV's, 42 incher in the living room and 32 incher in each of the bedrooms so we can all watch our own programming.  The DVD player and full stereo set up also make the week go by faster.  Word of advise, it's really a bore to stay in Vegas for an entire week with seniors and kids.

On the way home from a day at the beach, four young people seek shelter from a torrential downpour at the home of Lord and Lady Alexander after their car runs out of gas. They don't know it, but the house they're staying in is to be the site of a Satanic ritual. Jane (Camille [[Harrelson]]), the only female of the group, is to be sacrificed. As her male companions rush to her aid, one of them accidentally kills Lady Alexander. Things really get out of hand and everyone else attending the black mass is also killed. The four try to make an escape, but soon discover there's no escape from what they've witnessed. One by one, they meet their fates.  Gong into Tragic Ceremony, I was positive I would enjoy it. Slow-burn Gothic horror is right up my [[gateway]]. I'm also quite fond of some of Riccardo Freda's other movies like The Horrible Dr. Hichcock, The Ghost, and I Vampiri. Tragic Ceremony seemed to be a sure thing. Unfortunately, things don't [[ever]] [[operative]] out the way they should. The biggest tragedy with [[respects]] to Tragic Ceremony is the time [[me]] spent watching this [[bazaar]] of a [[scene]]. With a few minor exceptions, nothing about the film appealed to me or worked for me. The characters are unlikeable, the plot is incoherent and schizophrenic, and the pacing is terrible. There's a subplot about some cursed pearls that goes nowhere and only serves to confuse things even further. In addition, nothing interesting happens for most of the movie. By the time the four leads realize they're in danger, I was well past the point of caring. And I don't understand the reviews I've read that praise the acting of Camille Keaton. I suppose it's a terrific performance if you consider an emotionless daze to be acting. The three male leads are the very definition of nondescript. They do nothing to stand out. The supporting cast includes some genre favorites like Luigi Pistilli, Luciana Paluzzi, and Paul Muller, but none is given anything to do. In fact Muller's main contribution is a two minute long monologue at the end of the movie that attempts to explain what happened in the previous 80 or so minutes. It's a weak attempt to provide a wrap-up to a very weak movie.

I really enjoyed this Thai place and will be coming back when [[Jori]] in town.  The bartender Mercy and one of her assistants, Andrew, were so very friendly.  They made me feel very welcome.  When they asked how I was liking my food, you could tell that they really had an interest in me being pleased.  I like that kind of invested interest.  I shared my meal with some friends so I had three entree's.   - The Pad Thai was a nice rice dish with a complex dash of sweet and sour.  I ordered it about a [[2]] star.  I could have gone to a [[3]], I'm sure.  I was a newbie.  If you like hot, start with a 4 and go from there. - The short rib stir fried rice was good, but I wouldn't go there for that.  It was my least favorite of the three meals, though, I enjoyed it. - My favorite was the Three Color Curry.  That was wicked good.  It was a very flavorful soupy curry dish that you will need to mix your rice with (stir fried or white).  The unsung part of the meal was the pickled jalapeno's.  Apparently the pickling process makes the peppers sweet and the juice just blended well with all three of the meals that I added it to.  I'm a fan... I'll go back.
No offense to anyone who [[piloted]] this and [[wanna]] it, but I [[reviled]] it! It [[lingered]] on and on and there was not a very [[best]] [[intrigue]], also, too [[easy]] and the acting was so so...  I would give this snorefest a 2 at the most
I think the hype is what [[decease]] it for me.  Having seen Nora's on TV and reading all the positive reviews, I [[waits]] the best Italian food in town.  Especially since "this is where all the chefs go to eat", as per the Food Network.  We wanted to order the pasta [[minestrone]] but the bartender insisted we order the house special pork chops.  So it was fried [[guacamole]], some kinda fried [[carpaccio]] balls with saffron, and the aforementioned pork chops.  The calamari was typically [[destitute]], the same kind you'd get at Cheesecake Factory and the like.  The [[carpaccio]] balls were decent, though there wasn't much cheese or saffron in it.  We [[visualized]] like tools for listening to the bartender about the pork chops though.  It reminded me of Kitchen Confidential where the chefs try to push out the last of old meats on the customers.  At least the garlic bread was good, but they charge you for any additional baskets beyond the first.  This place just seems like an [[foreclosed]] Olive Garden, minus the unlimited salads and breadsticks.
This movie is an amazing [[travesty]].. the script is too funny.. if u watch it more than once you will enjoy it more. Though the comedy at times is silly but it really makes u laugh!!

Ridiculously [[appalling]] show!!!!  Hubby and I were completely astonished!   Sat in the "premium seats (the middle between splash zone and VIP)" section A, H 15&16.  Considered the VIP section but after seeing the seats, don't think they're really worth it...they seat further back but the seats are rather lush.  Guess it really boils down to whether or not you really want the champagne!  Saw some people in the splash zone move up to the 'premium seats' shortly after the first gig - I'd pay the extra $30 to not sit in the splash zone...but if you can choose seats in the 2nd row up I guess its good savings? I prefer Orchestra like seats so H did us just fine.  Don't look up any videos on this!  It's best to go in with no expectations...get ready to be blown away!! :)

After putting a mummy in a local museum goes through the cat-scan, a metal object in it's brain reacts adversely to the procedure, thus freeing the spirit,or phantom if you will, of the mummy, Belphegor. Due to convenient circumstances, Lisa, who lives close to the museum finds herself possessed by the evil spirit. Soon enough she's stealing the museum's Egyptian treasures out from under their nose. Detective Verlac comes out of retirement to catch the supernatural thief.  This is a serviceable enough, if you haven't seen any other incarnations of "Belphégor" before. If you have, I recommend skipping this [[exceptional]] version as it can't help but pale in comparison to the others despite the nice locals and scenery.It plays out like a (slightly) higher budgeted Sci-Fi Original film, and I don't really mean that as a compliment.

So excited about finally getting me some Wendy Noodles Cafe. SInce I only keep hearing rave reviews from all the [[place]] been blessed enough too have meet in life. Always fan of asian food and just fan of small free standing family own spots around town. Wendy Noodles Cafe has that vibe but also some of the food there putting out real creative and [[exciting]]. Since I was only my first visit BUT far from my last never really got into the interesting stuff.   The things I did try was the mango and shrimp salad, rib-eye Bao Burger, and order of kalbi. The mango salad was awesome! Refreshing BIG time with the mixed organic greens with nice spicy dressing, ample amount of fresh mango in the salad and the shrimp came on skewers two of them. I only wished they used the bigger size shrimp. Still it had really nice crust on the outside, taste the marinade or sauce on it (Really could have just ordered the shrimp on the skewer by itself), and nice size salad. It first course for me. Salad lot of food. Honestly feel Pan Asian mango and shrimp salad is better and really in league all its own........The rib-eye Bao Burgers more like sliders that just poop in your mouth. Two or three bites later want more more. Unfortunately only get three per order. The combination of the steamed bun and the rib-eye perfect on point! I love the flavor, and moist throughout every bite. The steam bun found memories of peking duck, steam bun, and oyster sauce. It not duck but for sure its next best thing combine with steam bun!!!!!!! Kalbi been craving so had too get order. The Kalbi was tapas style so don't expect full order just tease. It good tease. The flavor loved it. Just wished they had full order on the menu. It came with little kim chee. I really enjoyed the kim chee. It not too spicy spicy but just right. Just wished had more room too try more of the menu.  The menu is pretty large or felt like good size for small restaurant. I felt was  different they offer full page of tapa style food (hence where ordered the kalbi; most part all the items are under $10). Given it was my first check in another thing notice they add lot of new items throughout the menu from the new item logo. The desserts they offer shave ice. Yet another reason count on return visit. Really little of everything on the menu.   Service was great! They never rushed me came too my order. Never had empty glass. My last course the kalbi. I liked the fact they gave me heads up that one of the dishes that expect 10-15 mins. Kalbi it well worth the wait.   Wendy Noodles Cafe see you very soon my friend! So much more too try!!!

for a movie like this little hidden gem to come out in the 80s, its shocking how not a lot of people know about it.  this [[travesty]] is definitely worth a look. it has all the things you need for a horror movie. especially the good old chills.  i remember watching this movie for the first time about 15 years ago, but i couldn't remember the name of it, so i came to IMDb a few years ago to ask for help on finding the title. i eventually got the name of the title, and bought the movie. i still love it as much as i did all those years ago.  buy this movie!!

Although I haven't seen it yet, I know that Chaplin is a genius, and only someone of his talent [[should]] take on this [[audacious]] subject matter--a comedy about Hitler. All great satire is [[founded]] on going out on an edge. [[Similarly]], all great comedy deals with the other side--pathos. This film seems like it will skirt both sides. Like Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove, The Great Dictator [[discusses]] with [[histories]] through the distorted lens of satire. The only way to deal with the horrors of this world is by laughing at it. And hopefully, through laughter, we can learn to view the world in a new light. Another film that does this that [[occurs]] to my mind is Emir Kusturica's Underground, and Fando And Lis. So, let me watch the film first.
it's a very [[costly]] film . . .
This is the third Three Stooges short that the team ever made, and like a lot of their early ones, this is absolutely and totally hysterical! Now owning it on DVD as part of the Three Stooges Collection Vol. 1, whenever I feel like it, I watch this!   In this short film, Moe, Larry, and Curly play these three doctors in a hospital who are trying to help out everyone, but boy, they end up making a mess out of everything!  This short is another one of my all time favorite Three Stooges shorts, I also am a very huge fan of slapstick comedy, and the Three Stooges are the kings of slapstick!   When I heard that it got nominated for the Academy Award for Best Short Film, I really became curious about this, when I heard that it had lost, I was very disappointed about it!   This short is one of the Three Stooges funniest by far, I extremely recommend that you see this hysterical [[upheaval]]!   10/10

The submarine used was NOT Varangian! 'It' was in fact two boats, P614 and P615, both built for Turkey by Vickers Armstorng at Barrow-in-Furness but kept hold of by the Royal Navy for the duration of the war. P615 was sunk but P614 was eventually delivered in 1945.   The confusion no doubt arose because someone looked up P61 (as I did) and found Varangian! When in fact, the last digit of both P614 and P615 was in fact just painted out....  There are some extremely realistic moments in the [[travesty]]. These Turkish boats were very similar to the S-class. As no S-class submarines survive, the shots of them (as P61) and of the depot ship "Forth" form part of an interesting record now, as well as an excellent film.

On the heels of the well received and beloved coming of age film classic ,concerning the lives of teenagers as they headed into adulthood, George Lucas' American Graffiti, we have Cooley High. An adaptation of sorts by one Eric Monte, co creator of the popular 1970's CBS sitcom Good Times.  Cooley High was, and is, viewed as a black version of American Graffiti.Instead of central California ,as in American Graffiti, we have the black slum of Chicago's Cabrini Green as the backdrop for the story here. Instead of America in 1962 Cooley High is situated in 1964.The movie stars Welcome Back Kotter's ,Lawrence Hilton Jacobs and Glynn Turman as the movie main protagonists and its' main characters. It has Garrett Morris playing the principal who tries to keep Jacobs' and Turman's characters,named Coceise and Preach, out of trouble a great deal of the time.  You know, [[me]] would like to say that Cooley High is a [[meritorious]] comparison piece to American Graffiti or that it is a [[vast]] film on its' own but I can't. The problem lies with the fact that the producers of the film couldn't or wouldn't hide the sad underside of black life in America.Having the film in the Cabrini Green part of Chicago doesn't help things.  Neither does the crass gross attempts at humor here. When Coceise is looking for a letter of intent from a college he finds his little brother has thrown down a toilet. When the gang visits the Chicago Zoo, one of the gang named Pooter, has manure thrown on him by an ape. When the Turman's character,Preach, is being chased by two hoodlums in the school hangout(A dirty and depressing place to eat food in much less meet people at), he opens the door of the girls' bathroom while a girl is relieving herself as he escapes through the window of the same bathroom! The high school, the homes of the characters, the bathrooms, just about everywhere in the film displays the unfortunate look of urban decay and poverty.  If that wasn't enough there was the rough display of humor in the film. The use of violence and profanity in the film. Cooley High may be an coming of age film ,but it is a hard and rough coming of age film with little or none of the wit and liking of the use of nostalgia that made people like and appreciate American Graffiti so much.  Motown Records had a hand in making the film. The company's music was part of the film's soundtrack. But even here you get a sense of same old same old as one has heard these songs before a million times over. Not that they weren't great songs within themselves but black music,of that time period was more than just Motown.Especially in Chicago. The song nearing the end of the movie, by the Spinners' G.C. Cameron, was not all that impressive. There have been better Motown ballads that have been done, by better Motown artists than Cameron without question.  The last part of the film showing where the characters went to pay homage to the film Cooley High aimed to be ,American Graffiti. It shows that Preach,an intelligent but underachieving student went to Hollywood and became a successful television writer. Eric Monte may have patterned himself as Turman's character. The last shot of film show's Preach running away from Coceise's funeral ,held on a dark rainy afternoon, and all the bleakness that Cooley High came to represent. Eric Monte ,through Preach and that final scene, had one little lesson for all of us when watching Cooley High and for the love of the past. Don't look back.

This movie was really [[good]]. First they didn't even follow the facts for it. Half of the movie was made up and it was more about the deputy whose mother was one of Ed Gein's victims. The acting was horrible, except for the guy playing Ed Gein, but its not hard to mess up playing a weird guy. though i think it was horrible i gave it a three because they started it off with actual crime photos. that was the best part of the movie. As soon as the introduction of the movie was finished the movie went [[on]]. The writer of this movie tried to spice it up, but it didn't need to be. The story of Ed Gein is interesting enough without falsifying information.

We spent a week in this family friendly time share hotel, got the 2 bedroom "villa" compliments of my sis.  I was [[blithely]] surprised at how well thought out this place is.  With a full kitchen, washer and dryer, I totally overpacked since my mama was doing laundry everyday for some reason.  The rooftop pool is a nice touch but it's a bit small for so many people.  And the smoking area by the tiny "rooftop bar" is a bit disturbing especially considering most kids hang out by the pool.  The mandatory complimentary valet is a bit frustrating as well.  But besides from that, this is a [[lovable]] place to [[continues]].  We had 3 LCD TV's, 42 incher in the living room and 32 incher in each of the bedrooms so we can all watch our own programming.

36. THE HOSPITAL (comedy, 1971) A series of emergencies has gripped Manhattan Hospital. Patients are dying left and right due to overcrowded conditions, and a ineptitude staff. When a resident doctor is caught up in the death count the chief medical examiner, Dr. Bock (George C. Scott), is called in to investigate. Having worked as a doctor for too many years, and going through a mid-life crisis of his own, Dr. Bock finds the going tough. He decides to commit suicide. But then he meets Barbara (Diana Rigg), a young-hippie beauty. Whose keen insights on life help the depressed Bock.  Critique: Black comedy features a 'tour-de-force' performance from veteran actor George C. Scott. He's good at playing high-strung, serious characters [[my]] strict morals are severely tested. First half of the film unfolds like a melodrama, giving a pretty good account of hospital life, and the shambles they sometimes are.

Then. . .I find out that one of my doctors was killed by a couple of nurses. . .how am I to sustain my feeling of meaningfulness in the face of this?"

I'm usually a [[bit]] of "art" and "foreign" films, but when I saw this one my reaction was "it must be called experimental because it makes no [[mistake]]." The "action" is static, while at the same time it [[bounce]] from one location to another. There aren't enough titles to make it clear who is who and what their relationships are. Apparently the main point was to show that in the face of murder, adultery and generally weird and dissolute behavior, the cure offered by the powers that be is to banish a totally innocent black man.

I've always found the dilettante Man Ray and his artistic efforts to be deeply pretentious, and I've never understood why his work attracts so much attention. Apart from his Rayographs (which he invented by accident, and which are merely direct-contact photo prints), his one [[believable]] contribution to culture seems to be that he was the first photographer to depict female nudity in a manner that was accepted as art rather than as porn. But surely this had to happen eventually, and there's no real reason why Ray deserves the credit. The critical reaction to Man Ray reminds me of the story about the Emperor's New Clothes.  "L'Étoile de merde" ... whoops, "de mer" ... features a lot of blurry photography and a recurring visual theme of a starfish, which is never explained. Starfishes have the fascinating ability to regenerate lost limbs -- and even to regenerate entire duplicate bodies -- but, if that has anything to do with this movie's theme, Ray neglects to say so. I was much more impressed by this movie's title cards, which (in French) manage to include rhymes, a pun ('Si belle, Cybele') and some portmanteaux.  As so often in Ray's work, there is indeed a beautiful young woman seen in this movie. Unfortunately, the photography is (largely) so blurred that we have little opportunity to appreciate her. I'll rate this mess one point out of 10.

Nice movie. At the begining, i thought it's a medieve detective kind hi-fi movie, but the ending totally [[incredulous]] me. I guess, the whole movie covers too many subjects, each of them can be the main subject,e.g. avenge, friendship, and dream. But it mixed all of them without focusing on any of them. I think, it'd be a great movie if it's built around the ending from the very begining.

Why not try and remake it even, i promise it will be top earner, people love those sorts of stories, So please either release it and take us out of our misery or remake it,although i doubt if it could be improved upon.

Came here last night (Tuesday) to see the Great Gatsby. LOVED the film but on to the theatre.  It smelled so musty and closed up. I've been to dollar movie theatres that have smelled nicer. A lot of trash on the floor so somebody was not doing their job. Seats need a general makeover- the fabric is torn completely on some of them. The screen had 2 rips in them which was pretty just annoying since it was near the center. Me and my friend were in the theatre with only 2 other people so it was nice not worrying about other people.   I would [[still]] recommend this theatre to anyone.

[[where]]? What exactly are they famous for??  After living in Glendale for about 5 years, seeing people drive around with Pete's bumper stickers, and detouring around 55th and Glendale at rush hour because the drive-through [[highway]] backs up into the [[right]], we finally tried this. In the end [[me]] just have to ask what all of their "fans" are thinking.  The fish that's so famous looks and tastes [[from]] something you might get from the frozen [[meal]] section of the store. But only if you got the cheapest store brand possible and [[makes]] sure it was a SQUARE patty of [[fine]] breaded fish. The fish sandwich was one of the [[finest]] fish patties on a cheapo hamburger bun with a smear of sauce. [[no]] fries were questionable. Honestly, I'd [[definitely]] eat fish at Long John Silver's than eat here again.

A dark, yet humorous tale [[having]] a cop who has a first hand experience with vampires and decides he must quit his job to pursue these evil beings.Most of the film contained [[great]] [[character]],[[actors]], props, and filming. The fight scenes were as [[good]] as a middle schooler's rendition of a WWII [[fight]]. The lines delivered were spoken as if the actors had no [[motive]] for being there. The props were bad because they did not [[supposedly]] look like they could function in the slightest amount. the majority of the film appeared to be [[placed]] in someones basement (in some scenes you could see the rafters overhead in a scene that was not supposed to look like that of a basement). The plot had no motivation to move [[aside]] or go backwards, it just appeared to [[go]] still at times with no reason for some characters actions. I felt at times the sounds effects were out of place for this horror type genre and more of a cartoon series. It is [[compare]] to the movie Blade, in that he is an African American vampire hunter. However, that is where all similarities end, and the movie looks closer to a Saturday Night Live spoof.
The Hospital is a movie that was made ahead of its time. This film, produced by screenwriter Paddy Chayefsky, who gave us the Oscar-Winning film, "Network", deals with overworked staff, gross incompetence, and bureaucratic corruption at a large conglomerate hospital in Manhattan. George C. Scott, in a superb performance as the head physician, is driven to alcoholism and a death-wish, as he tries to recover from a divorce, throwing his son out of the house, and worst of all, a medical facility where corruption and incompetence take precedence over caring and healing of the sick and injured.  Mr. Scott makes the movie his own, and viewers will be shocked at what they observe at this medical establishment. You can feel the "pain" (pun intended) of what this hospital has done to him. The vivid images of this hospital's incompetence are so vivid and dramatically powerful that you may find yourself laughing and being deeply disturbed from scene to scene.  If only the film had stayed with that premise in a documentary style fashion as it starts out, this picture would be [[fantastic]]. Unfortunately, there is a sub-plot of Scott falling for the daughter of a senile patient. The patient has been murdering people at the hospital. This is where credibility of the picture becomes strained. The romantic dialog scenes add nothing to the picture, and the mental patient, posing as a doctor, I found to be totally unbelievable. A simple security call and records check should have prevented the senile patient from doing the killings. It takes almost the whole movie, before security people are brought into the film to get the patient out of the hospital. I could not see ONE PERSON doing that much damage, even as corrupt as this hospital is.  Furthermore, George C Scott's character is "overworked" (another pun intended) because the script has too many things happening at once. For example, within a period of 20 minutes, you could have as many as 20 different doctors accused and denying what they should have done or didn't do. With the nurses and aids, it's the same story. Someone's chart was read wrong, someone was given the wrong medication and died, the doctor operated on the wrong patient, than another doctor does the same thing, blaming a third nurse who was not on call because the second nurse who was supposed to be admitting the patient was on her coffee break. There is also a lot of subtle, dark humor with the same messages of incompetence and corruption being fed to the viewer.  This repetition of medical ineptness is unforgettable. However, the murder subplot is a distraction more than a help to this movie. When the focus of this film is on the incompetence of the staff and Scott's reactions to this, you are glued to the screen. But the conversations between Scott and the mad patient's daughter force the film into a mystery type "Who Done it?" scenario that seriously hurts the quality of the movie. When the loony patient is revealing how he did the killings, I wondered the following: Why did the producers need the "find the killer" mad-patient sub-plot? I think the only point of Scott's character having a relationship with the senile patient's daughter, was to give him anybody with whom to communicate. The Hospital should have maintained its scathing indictment of the medical profession by removing the love-interest and mad patient scenes. It should have focused on the incompetent B.S within its walls more frequently. In an era where this movie could have been phenomenal, the sub-plot stories make the film very good instead of the great masterpiece it could have been.
This is indeed the film that popularized kung fu in the 1970s. However, if it ever had any kind of excitement or even halfway interesting plot, it doesn't seem to have aged very well.  Long story short: extremely drawn out, slow-moving, [[puzzling]] plot with run-of-the-mill choreography, typically annoying and exaggerated whiplash sounds with every punch and kick, and constant "plot twists" that never come to an end. By the time the film reaches its emotional climax, I had long had all the wind knocked out of me to actually care.  Watch it for its historical value as a milestone of Chinese kung fu cinema -- just leave your expectations at the door, or you'll be bitterly disappointed.  For hardcore fans only.
Not a terrible film -- my 10 year old boy loved it, and he would be the target demographic, so I guess they hit the spot. [[seems]] dull for an adult though.  Hard to relate to animated lego characters, even mod high-tech ones.  I thought the choice of the three great virtues of the Bionicle world was a bit odd -- unity, duty, and destiny. Am I the only one who thinks those sound just a bit fascistic? Especially destiny. What about freedom, equality, justice, etc.?  Oh well, it will sell Lego. Kind of dull for a movie, but not bad for a 74-minute advertisement. Could have been a lot worse.

Just opposite Cineworld in Fountainbridge, Wing Sing Inn provides a truly Chinese experience, in sometimes amusing ways.  Their menu, for example, features appetising items such "Water Swamp Morning - glory in Malaysian style" and "Salt & Pepper Fog Leg," and when we phoned to place our order, they answered initially in Chinese, and even when persuaded to speak English had a [[blunt]] manner that made no concession to conventional notions of customer service.  Nevertheless, this did not [[entertain]] from our enjoyment of the food they delivered.  Me and my friends steered away from the more, umm, unusual sounding dishes and stuck with things like Pak Choi with Mushrooms and Yu-Hung Aubergine which were excellent and came with delightful garnishes.  The many Chinese customers who frequent this restaurant bear witness to the fact that Wing Sing Inn, despite its cheesy name, is the real deal for authentic Asian cooking.

To [[subpoena]] [[Jas]] [[Bacall]] and [[Tag]] Ryan on one of the many DVD commentaries, that "[[spindly]] [[electronica]]" over the HTV logo was enough to [[ai]] me [[pounce]] from whatever I was doing to glue my [[frente]] against the [[screening]] for an hour. The individual stories [[describes]] within the series were excellent and the [[personality]] [[design]] was wonderful. [[Robyn]] of [[Brewton]] goes through a very [[unconvincing]] [[touring]] over the two series he appears in, even [[unless]] his departure from the [[programmer]] was [[unintentional]].

After [[floundering]] for many [[annum]] in TV wasteland, I re-encountered the [[serial]] on Sky 1 in the UK in the mid [[seventies]] and was even more impressed that the series seemed even better than I remembered.

To quote my previous review:  "I'm calling this 3.75 Stars, but I'd easily give another star if there was some mango sticky rice available with the boofay for dessert, but I'll admit that's a lot to ask. "  == Well, I didn't get my Mango Sticky Rice, but the Saturday boofay contained a few items not there during weekday lunch, including a wonderful Thai Custard Tart with Apple slices and a seasonally updated version of the fruit salad with tons of ripe mango, strawberry, and pineapple.  The hot line had a few extras as well.  There were more seafood dishes than during the week,  a unique thai 'salsa' with diced green/red peppers and avocado, and a new crispy tofu number I hadn't ever seen before.  I also got to experience the same level of friendly, attentive service I've grown to expect, but from a completely different set of staff.  Consistency like this points to a [[awfully]] [[justly]] run establishment.  So since I promised I'd do it, 4.75 stars!

Eines der schönsten [[Pubs]] in Karlsruhe mit außergewöhnlicher Innenarchitektur in einem schönen Jugendstilgebäude in der Nähe des Schloss' gelegen.

I agree with two of the other reviewers - this place is [[monstrous]].  We ordered fish and shrimp combo.  It was over deep [[marinated]] and crispy - almost brick like.  I had never seen shrimp [[even]] over breaded and cooked that you don't recognize it as shrimp underneath.  The monster burger was ok, nothing special but piled on with so many condiments (that I was not asked if i wanted) that is was dripping like liquid.    And you have to pay extra for the sauces!!!  What?

This film, based on the book by Pascal Laime' -La Dentelliere- is an acclaimed [[result]] of excellent cinematography and costly Italian language. Set in a "scholastic" 19th Century, [[historical]] set, it portraits the story of a mad love story: a man and a woman. [[this]] is an infamous line at this shadowy-Mussolinni strike which reads: "She does not smell like tomatoes." Sage perfumery of this Italian masterpiece, [[man]] is a director of the stature of Mussolinni: his cake will jump in your strawberries and if you let this director he will cream your olives as a Superman. Remember Nietzsche? This one will scare the HELL out of YOU: don't forget to visit Mussolinni's cake next to the Colisseum in Rome, across the Via Appia. This movie will wipe your Pampers inside-out and outside-in, it will make you cry out of Romantic joy! If you liked Ulysses, you will wipe it good with these strawberries until the end of the roll. Enjoy!

I don't know how this film went unnoticed for so long.  I saw this film on TV, i was flipping through the channels and came across this unexpectedly [[adequately]] made film. i missed the first, probably , 10 minutes, but that does not matter..this film literally gripped me, it is a [[hardheaded]] spine chiller.  The absence of well known actors in the film adds on to the effect,u do not know what to expect from the actors because they are new. U never know when they will get killed or what they are up to. so it is all the more tense.Even though there are many new faces their performances were top class.  The filmmakers play with your mind, just revealing enough gore to make imagine the rest. The shock, fear, horror and helplessness are also brought out well by characters in the film.  The well written situations n twists,fast camera movements, slick editing and superb direction makes it an excellent suspense thriller. This film actually switches between the genres - horror and suspense thriller leaving the viewer clueless and tensed. Undoubtedly comparable to Hitchcock.   I could not even move from the TV even during the commercial breaks .. i was the helpless MUTE WITNESS to this [[ravishing]] film.

One word that describes Thai Spices is "[[alrite]]".    Located in [[laos]] Plaza, it took over the old BoCa 7 space.  When walking in the place, you'll notice its nice decor.  alas, it was left behind by the previous tenant (yes that is real gold wall paper fyi).  The place was quiet for a Friday night and we came there for my bday.  Apparently happy hour is extended till 7:30pm but its not stated or noted anywhere.  Since we had a big party, we ordered a multiple of their [[entree]].  The most notable ones are surprisingly not thai related.  The crab [[bursting]] were very unique and good as well as the calamari rings.  Who would of thought the secret sause (thousand island) would make a diffrence.  After that, everything pretty much went down hill from there.  The thai dishes were not very good.  We had the pad thai, a little on the sweet side, plus the portions are a little small.  Also the green curry was salty, i have a very salty palate, but even this was more than my liking.  But it was good though, good with rice that is.  Also even though we got it "mild" it still had a healthy kick of spices.  The Thai fried rice was also mediocre and a lil on the oily side.  The Tom Yum soup was good.  Again nothing special but atleast it didnt taste off.  Again this was a lil on the salty side too.  The only notable dish that we had was the Papaiya salad with salted crab.  That has a unique after taste.    So in review, if you were at MeKong Plaza and had a craving for Thai food, then lucky you.  But its not a place you'd actually actively seek out if you werent literally already there.    Pros: -happy hour specials daily 4 to 7:30Pm (supposedly) -great happy hour specials that are actually delish! - great decor hahahha  Cons: - food is sub par - thai specialties are sub par - thai tea wasnt a home run. - prices are not reflective of the quality and quantity.

The [[luster]] of this story delivers at least one skillfully crafted message to each viewer in the audience. This story is about success, it's about failure. It's about the choices you make in life and the choices others make for you. The story deals with self realization and determination on a scale so large, no camera angle could cover it. Within the grasp of each scene is resides an element marked for depiction within your imagination. Keep this in mind as you watch the movie; it's more than eye candy. The sexually suggestive, rarely explicit scenes serve only to distract and entertain you during the tedious process of character development.

If you are looking for a film that is [[hurry]] [[mouthed]] and won't bore you then this is the place. It is fast paced and [[bizarre]] with some decent [[behaving]] comeing from the characters. It is always hard for me to see Mark Walhberg as anything except Marky [[Signalled]]. That image is [[incinerated]] in my mind forever. As an actor though he is pretty good. This movie is a must see for action [[fanatics]] who like to see a [[scrawny]] little [[tendrils]] and turns. I [[go]] [[enjoy]] to pick this movie up one day and buy it.
an [[unlucky]] title for a film that has [[something]] [[likable]] about it .
I can honestly tell you that this movie is the most [[unbelievable]] movie ever!!! If you are in the mood for a comedy, I totally recommend this movie! So, here's the summary. There is this girl(Nikki) who is fourteen and a half and she goes on a vacation with her father(Andre) whom she hasn't seen for about two years. She expects the vacation to be totally boring, until she meets this boy(Ben), who is much older than she is. So, to try to impress him she says that she isn't on vacation with her father, but her lover. This is a hysterical [[theaters]] from beginning to end, and I highly suggest it. So rent it and [[fond]]!!!

The DVD release of this movie hopes you will buy this movie on the name and face of Sandra Bullock. Her picture (from years after this film) basically is the cover art... and the back cover art... and the inside cover art... the same picture. Her name is prominently shown on the front cover, all 4 edges and the disk itself. She is the first name in the list of stars. Her biography is printed inside the case. This film must revolve around her character, right? [[MALA]]! It is her first movie and she plays a minor role. After watching the movie, every role seems like a minor [[task]]. The character [[Schnauzer]] actually displays some personality. Less than an hour after watching it, I don't even remember the names of many characters.  Maybe if I watched it several more times, I could actually figure out the plot, but I don't think it would be [[priceless]] the effort.  Oh, wait, I just remembered a funny bit! Shoot-em-up video game fans will get a kick out of the "Doom-cam". Looks just like a first-person shooter game. Hands and gun pointing out in front of the camera.  I am generally not a person to be critical of movies, but this may be the worst movie I have ever seen. I kept expecting some silhouettes to walk across the screen, sit down and start making fun of it.  I'm just glad that the money we spent on this (used) went to charity.
Perhaps I'm just a simple person, but I prefer movies that somehow make me care about the people in them. I couldn't care less about anyone in this movie. This was supposed to be a comedy? Maybe the humor was too subtle for me (all the way down to the nano-level). The thing about it is, it missed on so many things. There were characters that could have been [[outlandish]], but they weren't. There were characters that you could have liked, but you didn't. For instance, the guy who thought the Beatles ripped off his songs. There was so much potential there, but all he did was talk like a Beatle and complain about how they ripped him off. Haha. And the previous poster talked about the 'I am the Walrus' scene like it was special. What? He played 'I am the Walrus' on an old piano and sang out of tune. Is there an inside joke there? It sure [[musty]] at face value. This movie has the feel to me of a movie people say they like because it sounds 'intellectual' or 'hip' to say you like it, that you get the whole metaphysical art/garbage message the artist is expressing. If you want to be entertained, stay away.

Tasty! Very tasty! Ok so I've never been to the East Coast and I'm an Arizona Native so the only comparison for this burger joint is other burger joints in the valley.   The burger is actually a double, you order the toppings individually, and they have the standards. They make it in front of you which is nice. The pattys were tasty and the buns were some of the best on a burger i've ever had!! Fries were good as well.  We ordered two burgers, one side of fries and one drink and the total was $18.xx. Expensive? Well it's more expensive than McDonalds of course but not more than a restaurant, it's a [[okay]] middle ground. I think you pay for the quality. I definitely don't mind paying extra for a great tasting quality burger!   The decore was......um....interesting. [[Wholly]] white everywhere. [[Peanut]] as an appetizer?!? And on the [[walls]] was non-local [[evaluation]]. I [[adequately]] [[receive]] local reviews but that's all [[little]]. I went to [[perceive]] a good tasting non-fast food chain burger and that's what [[me]] got. I'm [[optimistic]], and will be returning, probably several times.

this movie has NO plot. it was SUPPOSED to be that a guy moves in with his grandma, and everyone thinks hes a loser and he has to redeem himself. but what happens after everyone finds out who he's living with? they have a big pot party at grandma's house. the climax of the movie didn't even [[thereto]] to the rest of it. that whole plot was introduced within minutes of the movie's end. i can see how it COULD have related to the supposed story - that Grandma's VG skills redeem him - but that just wasn't there.   However, the movie was funny as hell and clearly [[deduced]] heavily on the jokes.

Came here with a [[communal]] of [[classmates]] on a Friday night. We sat down for what [[arose]] [[liked]] [[invariably]] before a single [[severs]]/[[servers]] acknowledged our existence. Yeah - so we looked like a sorry [[tape]] of recently released inmates all [[hungover]] up and nowhere to go but still! So finally this waiter [[aim]] to take our drink orders. We ordered a round and asked for menus. We were then [[avowed]] that they stop serving actual food around 10pm even though the place will serve alcohol till 2am. Really? You have a crapload of people all drinking and getting loaded for the next four hours but you don't want to serve food anymore because  you'd rather give that [[entrepreneur]] to one of your many competitors nearby? What kind of North Korean rocket scientist running this place came up with that idea? It's ok though because a competitor DID make quite a few $$$ off us that night on both drinks AND food.  And next time we'll know not to bother [[lost]] our  time here.
Though I had sort of [[preferred]] THE SATANIC RITES OF Dracula (1974), I knew I shouldn't expect too much from its even more maligned predecessor! Surely the least of the Hammer Draculas (Marcus Hearn on the Audio Commentary for THE CREEPING FLESH [1973] even goes so far as to call it the studio's nadir!), the film really [[stands]] due to its totally unhip - and now embarrassingly dated - updating of the myth (the modern-day setting actually [[plays]] SATANIC RITES rather better)...even if, truth be told, it's still vastly preferable to dreck like Dracula 2000 (2000) or VAN HELSING (2004)!  Despite Christopher [[fans]] vociferous bashing of the film, he still cuts an undeniably striking [[picture]] as the undead vampire (even if he appears very little and is inexplicably confined to one setting); likewise, Peter Cushing delivers his [[finest]] committed performance. The only other noteworthy acting job in the film is that given by Christopher Neame (son of director Ronald) as Johnny Alucard(!) - even if that's only because of how unbelievably hammy it is! Unfortunately, the two best-known female members of the cast (both of them horror regulars) - Stephanie Beacham and Caroline Munro - can't rise above their physical attributes.  The camera-work is by Dick Bush (who had shot THE BLOOD ON SATAN'S CLAW [1971] and, for Hammer, WHEN DINOSAURS RULED THE EARTH [1970] and TWINS OF EVIL [1971] - but is perhaps best known for his longtime association with Ken Russell) which manages some nice atmosphere throughout, especially during three crucial sequences: the carriage-ride scuffle at the (properly Gothic) beginning; the hysterical Black Mass sequence, followed by the resuscitation of Dracula; and the final confrontation between Lee and Cushing's Van Helsing.

The premise of the story is common enough; average family wants out of the rat race; wants to find the simple life....so they move from Sherman Oaks,California to Lake Tomahawk; kids in tow.  The lake is beautiful, they have leased an old house....but wait; there may be something in the lake; people are being murdered, and no one knows how (never mind why). Gerald McRaney is excellent, a familiar face for Lifetime viewers; Valerie Harper is also good; since this [[travesty]] was made in '88 maybe the writer should produce a sequel!.  You will also enjoy Barry Corbin as the town eccentric, and Darryl Anderson as a Bruce Dern-lookalike/crazed military man.  While the story plot is a bit over the top; if you are a movie buff you will be reminded of similar scenarios from ""Psycho""; ""Deliverance""; as well as other horror stories of that genre. Several camera shots and sequences will give you a sense of deja vu.  Sit back and enjoy; if you don't take it too seriously it is very entertaining; and better than, for example the more recent movie:  ""I Know What You Did Last Summer""; it seems they made better movies in the good old 80's!.

Truly unique and stunning film of Jules [[became]] "For The Flag" by the Czech master director Karel [[friedman]].Although the story is enacted in a rather understated late Victorian [[sense]], the visuals are a knockout. Zeman uses [[visuals]], graphics, painted sets, model animation combined with [[actual]] action to create the atmosphere of Verne that the [[writer]] associates in his mind. The style resembles the steel [[ies]] of Dore and Bennet and Riou that illustrated these stories with a healthy [[sense]] of Georges Melies added.Photographed in beautiful black and white the animation is of the [[lowest]] order and not of a Saturday morning [[quality]]. There are underwater sequences where the fishes swimming about are so accurately [[etched]] they can be used in a field guide.There are images of ships ,submarines, flying craft, [[missiles]],and machinery that are [[built]] in such accurate detail that one must have a freeze [[tte]] on his VCR or DVD to pause the [[proceedings]] and study the remarkable detail that went into this production.The late [[victorian]] atmosphere is designed to look like this [[earth]] that never was and delight us in the magic of science that [[claims]] Verne the great father of the genre. If this is not [[so]], there [[too]] is the film score that probably is one of the [[least]] ever created for a fantasy or sci-fi film.Truly a forgotten classic, this one is worth hunting down and buying. Always one of my favorite films of all times, it is sure to be one of yours too. And remember- this was done decades before CGI or computer animation. Kudos to the great artists who obviously put their heart into it. It shows. Jules Verne himself would be proud of this movie.A film that deserves to be better known, but those who have seen it love it-and treasure it. An outstanding achievement , this remarkable film just gets better every time you watch it. A true cinematic work of art from a visionary director.

This place was my savior when my washing machine packed in between Christmas and New Year. A time of year when repairs do not happen quickly because everyone is too busy eating, drinking and being merry. And quite rightly so!   So I hurried in here with a bag full of washing and the nice lady took it off me and told me to come back the next day. When I went back everything was cleaned and folded [[completely]]. It was like having my mum do my laundry again! I used the launderette a couple of times afterward, and occasionally when I come back from a trip and can't be chewed washing and drying a suitcase of clothes. [[Any]] time the clothes come back clean (which is the main thing I guess!) and [[coldly]] [[wrinkly]]. It is nice to have folded laundry now and again!   This place always has bags and bags full of nicely folded laundry, so I guess it is pretty popular and I can see why.

USAA is the best of the best of the best. I'm not kidding. They know what they're doing Everything from their website navigation, user friendly online banking, and their SUPERB customer service. "Really?" "Superb." "Keep it up." "Superb." "Say it again." "Superb."  Well, Empire Records quote out of the way, I have been with USAA ever since... forever. I was grandfathered in under my Dad who is a retired USAF Lt. Colonel. Actually, I first started dealing with them directly when I opened my first Master Card as an 18 year old before moving out and going to college. And then soon after I dealt with USAA's customer service line numerous times because my car loan and car insurance are through them.  Whenever I called them about anything their customer service representatives have been angels. I say they've been angels because compared to other customer service reps at other companies I've spoken to these [[individuals]] have to be from another plane of existence to consistently be so [[excited]]. I've [[said]] crying because I locked my keys in my car, or just [[confusion]] over something having to do with registering my car and not being [[eligible]] to get my proof of insurance printed out in enough time (gee, the wonders of a irresponsible teenage college student). But every time they have been great. Going on 9 years now they have never let me down.  As soon as I snag myself a full time job I am moving my checking account over to USAA. They offer direct deposit and deposit from home. They also offer a set amount of money to be returned to your bank account at the end of every month if you happen to take out money at one of those nasty ATMs that charge you an arm and a leg for use. I hate that and knowing I could get that money back would be awesome.   My plan is to be with USAA forever. I have no reason to switch to anyone else. They've been in my family for a long time. My parents, me, my brother, and sister have all been with them for some reason or another and they have never done us wrong.

I am going to start calling this "Disney Walgreens". It's [[big]], well [[populated]], has a mini grocery section, and is [[fairly]] clean.   I [[turned]] into the Take Care Health Care Clinic this morning-- no appointment, and had to wait for about a half an hour, which was fine, [[given]] that [[my]] was able to sign in and then meander [[near]] the gigantic store for the majority of the time that I [[looked]] there.  Barbara (Barb) was the RN who [[tended]] me with what I thought was an ear infection. She did the normal doctor thing, and then wrote me a prescription. She was very nice and funny. She was also [[overly]] interested in the swelling that I had in my throat because it wasn't any of the "[[recommended]]". She recommended that I take an antibiotic for 72 hours, and if the swelling had not gone down, to go to an Urgent Care or the ER. I really appreciated that she took the time to thoroughly check me out and that she didn't make up a fake diagnosis, and came right out and said that she wasn't exactly sure what it was. Really [[nice]] the honesty.  Let's cross our fingers and hope it is just some obscure infection and that penicillin will get it gone.  Overall, very pleasant experience. Also, took my Aetna insurance. Woo!

Judging a pho restaurant is pretty easy: try their pho at 9am when they first open and before you add anything to the broth see how it tastes. If it tastes good at 9am the restaurant is very good. In this case, we came to Pho 1 at 8:55am and I was a little nervous as some restaurants like to make their broth at 7am and its honestly not ready at 9am or even 10am. In this case, the pho had been cooking all night and it was [[unthinkable]]. If you like pho I would highly, highly recommend Pho 1.

I really [[rained]] this movie. I have a real sense of justice and 'an eye for an eye', and this movie delivers that in spades. Glenn Ford is offered a very low price for his ranch by the big rancher in the valley; then one of his ranch hands is beaten and shot 'to help him make up his mind about selling'. When the ranch hand dies, and the sheriff refuses to do anything, Ford seems at first reluctant to do anything, cautioning his men to not take things into their own hands. But, that's just what he is about to do. I knew this movie was about to catch fire when he went into the saloon and faced the guy (Richard Jaeckel, one of my very favorite bad-guy character actors) who had killed his ranch hand; after a gentle exchange of dialog with him, Glenn Ford slaps his face and shoots him dead. Kind of a neat added bit of justice, he kills this guy with the gun that had belonged to his murdered cowhand. In short order we're treated to Ford letting his ranch be burned, so his men are justified in ambushing the crew from the other ranch; then Ford and his men stampede all the horses and cattle of the big bad guy's ranch; then they show up and burn the outbuildings and the big fancy house to the ground. Talk about getting even big-time. Lots of action in this movie. There's more to the story than this, but I'll just recommend you watch the movie. Glenn Ford was someone who showed time and again what can happen when you misjudge someone, and I really enjoyed watching him get justice the old fashioned way.

I've read a lot of reviews about Showtime on IMDb and [[few]] seem to miss the mark. I've noticed a lot of reviewers calling this the typical "buddy" film. De Niro is in no way Murphy's buddy throughout most of this movie. In [[reality]], part of the [[humor]] of this film is De [[dicate]] reluctance to be friends with anybody.  Murphy really [[gives]] in this one. He is back at doing what he does best, [[seeming]] like a complete ham. He is a cop who wants so much to be an actor and enjoys being in the reality show. De Niro is perfect as the straight man who thinks the entire thing is stupid. I thought the two of them had great chemistry and were a perfect casting choice. Rene Russo is also great as the TV producer. Of course, she loves everything Murphy does and tries so hard (along with Murhpy) to get DeNiro going too.  A lot of reviewers have touched on the hilarious scene with William Shatner, reprising his role as TJ Hooker to train Murhpy & De Niro how to "act" like cops. But, my favorite scene involves Murphy in the "confessional" hoping he could get a Wesly Snipes-Like cop to team up with instead of De Niro. Man, that was hilarious! Comedies often depend on your personal tastes. Sure you could poke holes in the plot, most often you can with a comedy. I was psyched to see the pairing of Murphy and De Niro...I think it brought out the best in Murphy, which was nice to see him at the top of his game again. I can only imagine it was a great honor for Murphy to be paired with the great De Niro. Rating 8 of 10 stars.

Admittedly, the only reason I watched this film -- since it's been about a decade since it was released -- was because of Ian Holm; I was intrigued to see his portrayal of my second-favorite character in this play. At any rate, this film is as gritty as anything the Old Zeff has produced since "Jesus of Nazareth." [[Although]] some of the best parts of the play have been left out. I understand the directing/editing choices, but I don't think that it really does justice to the play. Perhaps I'm too much a purist. I would have to direct people (who have read this far) toward Branagh's version, if it weren't that I despise his tendency toward over-dramatization. All the same, he plays a better Hamlet than Gibson. But then, weren't we all waiting for Gibson to prove himself as an actor? Now, all he's done is to prove that he wants to make films in extinct languages.  ...Perhaps the only Shakespearean-worthy acting here is Scofield as The Ghost.

Harlan Banks is thief at the top of his game, but, after a successful career, he has decided to settle down with his woman and retire. However, he decides to take one last routine job in Las Vegas. All he has to do is drive the car and it seems simple. Unfortunately someone tips the police and after a hectic car chase he winds up in the slam only to escape and take revenge on those who betrayed and got him there in the first place. A [[regular]] action-fest ensues.  Steven Seagal plays himself (surprise!) wearing a trench-coat and sporting his beloved Colt 1911 along with his usual bone-breaking aikido. The Colt and aikido have always been with him, but the first I recall him with the trench-coat is in 'The Foreigner.' It isn't particularly impressive, but it does add a little notch to Seagal's lethal arsenal of badassness. Or it covers up those extra pounds he is packing. Look at it however way you choose. His main buddy throughout the film is played by Treach (another new thing, a rapper in an action movie) and they both uncover a little conspiracy of bad-guys, on both sides of the law, and give each evil-doer his due.  The film's main problem is that is it painfully, and I truly mean painfully, unoriginal. Seagal just follows a clockwork plot throughout the movie and even that manages to get more and more dull as the film progresses. Then it goes from dull to utterly ridiculous in the final scene as people who seemed to be dead on killing each other suddenly, for no reason, start to talk. Groan inducing in every sense of the word. The only real positive thing here is the decent opening - a car chase in Las Vegas complete with flipping police cars and generally entertaining mayhem, but after that brief highlight you've seen it all before. 3/10  Rated R: constant violence and profanity

A [[terrible]] debut film from Murali K. Thalluri that explores events in the life of a group of high school students, each of them in crisis in one way or another. The film starts with the discovery of the body of one of the students, then traces the lives of the group over the previous hours, leaving the audience in suspense until the last minutes as to the identity of the deceased. Each of the main characters is facing major stressors which we could see as potentially precipitating a suicide. The cast of unknowns provide performances full of power and emotion. Fantastically well done, especially considering the youth of the writer/director who was 19 years old when he wrote the script.

One of master director Alfred [[von]] finer films this is the story of an American and his [[relatives]] (James Stewart, Doris Day, and their young son) who are [[operating]] in north Africa. Stewart is a doctor and Day is a world famous singer. [[you]] meet a Frenchman who speaks the native language and [[saved]] them out of an incident on a local bus. Later one, the Frenchman whispers [[information]] into Stewart's ear after he is attacked and dying. [[any]] rest of the film is a puzzle as Stewart tries to [[question]] them and solve the mystery. The movie is [[drowned]] in mystery and strangeness from the exotic locale to the odd occurrences. You [[scarcely]] [[even]] know what's going on in this [[movie]], why people are appearing, until the end and [[well]] then you're not sure. The [[last]] scene takes [[part]] in Albert Hall and is one of the most famous in film which lasts for 12 [[years]] with no dialog. Hitchcock had originally made this film in 1934.

Don't get me wrong, I love Stephen King! And this is a pretty good movie over all. The rabid Cujo is very scary and the movie is suspenseful. But after the first few minutes that poor Donna and her little son Tad were held captive in their Pinto by the rabid St. Bernard, I began to wonder why she didn't do something to help herself.  She could have stuck her foot out the door and pushed the car backwards (I mean, it was a Pinto for Pete's sake and they were on a downhill incline) and rolled to safety, but then it would have been a very short movie. When she got the car started, did she pop it into reverse and hope that she could get at least get part way down the driveway? No, she tries to make a three point turn in a car with a bad alternator. She did manage to get out of the car and look around for 45 seconds or so at one point to try and get to a baseball bat that was lying on the ground nearby--what a [[rubbish]] of time! I mean, if you're going to make a run for the bat, do it and at least you'll have something to hit the dog with. But, forget the bat. Were there no tools in the car, like a tire iron or something? I didn't see her looking in the spare tire well of the car. Really, why wait until you're bitten and weak from dehydration and your son is having seizures before you make a stand against the animal?  At the end of the movie she was battered and torn, but by God she was still wearing high heels!

This movie is [[terrific]]. It creates characters not in the book, and some of them are ethnic or racial stereotypes. Including an obnoxious little Jewish boy and a politically correct little black girl. Not to mention the Yiddish speaking elves. The book was a simple story about belief, and this movie is a dark, ugly, and needlessly scary movie about nothing.  The animation is superb, but the story has been ruined by Hollywood.  The good thing is that this movie will take a bath in the box office and maybe producers will learn to keep from tampering with a story that needs no improvement. Hanks was overdone and i don't see why there couldn't have been other actors' voices be used.

'Doppleganger', ( or 'Journey To The Far Side Of The Sun' as it is more commonly known ) was written ( with input by the late Donald James ) and produced by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson, best known for their 'Supermarionation' television shows such as 'Thunderbirds'.  The international space agency Eurosec discovers the existence of a mysterious planet on the other side of the sun, and proposes a manned flight be sent there. The committee balk at the exhorbitant cost, and shelve the project. But when a security leak at the agency is discovered, fearing that the Russians might get there first, the project gets the green light.  American astronaut Glenn Ross ( Roy Thinnes ) is teamed with British scientist John Kane ( Ian Hendry ). After weeks of gruelling training, the Phoenix blasts off, heading for the unknown.  Three weeks later, their ship crashes in what appears to be a bleak, mountainous landscape. Ross survives, but Kane is badly injured. A light is seen moving towards them...  I will leave the synopsis here. Until this point, the film has been [[lauded]], with excellent special effects ( by Derek Meddings ) and music by Anderson's resident composer Barry Gray ( why it has not been issued on C.D. is a mystery ). But when Ross and Kane crash land, and we discover the secret of the alien world - it is a duplicate of our own, everyone on it is the same, the only major difference is that things are reversed - it becomes less interesting, and ends with a shattering anti-climax. I think the cinema was the wrong place to do this idea, in fact Gerry & Sylvia later did something similar on their 'Space: 1999' show. Ross risks ( and ultimately loses ) his life in an effort to return to Earth - his Earth. But why? The new Earth is so similar he might as well not have bothered.  Roy Thinnes had recently done 'The Invaders' television series, and gives a competent performance ( pity there weren't more scenes like the one where he rows with his wife ). Ian Hendry is good as 'Kane', but vanishes from the story too soon. Several actors went on to appear in the Andersons' 'U.F.O.' such as Ed Bishop and George Sewell. Blink and you will miss Nicholas Courtney ( 'The Brigadier' from 'Dr.Who' in a tiny role ). But the acting honours go to the late Patrick Wymark as 'Jason Webb', head of Eurosec. The character is not far removed from 'Sir John Wilder', the one he played in A.T.V.'s 'The Power Game'. Webb is such a devious character he is marvellous to watch. Herbert Lom's contribution ( as a spy with a camera hidden in a false eye ) amounts to little more than a cameo.  Like I said, the special effects are marvellous, as are the sets. So the film is worth watching, but do not expect very much to happen once the action moves to the mirror planet. With a stronger script, this could have been another 'Planet Of The Apes' or - dare I say it - '2001: A Space Odyssey'.  In Anderson's productions, he made the future seem like a great place, an adventure playground where science was cool, everyone had swank cars whose doors opened vertically, sexy women, and absolutely no suggestion that anything is seriously wrong with the world. We are in the future now and people are still watching 'Coronation Street' every other night. How disappointing. If a mirror Earth really exists somewhere, one hopes that is a better place than this one. If all the women there look like Lynn Loring or Loni von Friedl, I will be on the next flight!

I am not familiar with the producer's other works, but this movie is a piece of [[fun]].   I never saw the MST3K version, but I can tell you, Mike and the Bots probably didn't save it.   I love a grade-z movie as much as the next bad movie fan, but this was almost unwatchable.  There was no credit for who did the voice of "The Dark One". Sounded a bit like Patrick Stewart at times.  A group of high school students who found a junk super-8 camera in the trash heap could make a better movie than that.

This [[travesty]] is not about the soda nor is it quite the French Connection.  The Seven Ups are a group of elite policemen that use tactics not in accordance with protocol of the NYPD. Scheider heads the group with his posse or regular looking joes. They are running surveillance on a local costra nostra cartel and things go awry when a cop's wire is found out.  Meanwhile, Richard Lynch, the most evil looking man in film (Invasion:America, Little Nikita) and his partner end up killing the cop by accident and escape from Scheider in the coolest chase scene I've seen, Bullitt and French Connection are not as good as they one up the West Side to the George Washington and onto the Palisades Parkway in New Jersey.   The stunt drivers are terrific and Lynch makes it away free though he looks scared witless from the dangerous trip. Roy Scheider is nearly killed when his car slams into the abutted rear of Mack truck ripping the roof of his vehicle off.   Things come to a head and one has to keep watching to follow up on such a sequence. Quick moving and intense, fresh for a thirty years.

Yes, the video cover of this movie made me want to watch this film as a child. It was called "Screamers" on this particular cover with the tagline "Men turned inside out!". It even [[characters]] this warped looking skeleton on the cover as well that [[accomplished]] all sorts of cool gory images run through my [[spirits]]. Perhaps some [[categories]] of movie about some strange virus that caused a person's flesh to burn off, maybe a movie about undead zombies that are more bloody looking than what you usually get, a science experiment gone incredibly wrong and now strange men with the flesh dripping off their bones go on the rampage. Yes, all these thoughts ran through my mind, one that did not was fish guys on some island with virtually no gore and all bore. This movie is really more like the Island of Dr. Moreau than anything else and quite frankly that movie [[bores]] me too, it is way to much scientist and not enough killing for my tastes. [[This]] films are to [[considerable]] figure [[things]] out and not enough blood for my tastes. [[Aw]] [[me]] know, I have strange tastes, but I can not help it, I like my horror [[moviemaking]] either really bloody or fast moving and exciting this movie is [[fully]] neither.

Skilled professionals live it up in an exotic and dangerous location. They get drunk every night. They smuggle opium. They drop pigs in parachutes. They fly under impossibly hazardous conditions. They dress weird and act weirder. [[feel]] [[bad]], outrageous. They violate every rule of command and have contempt for their employers at the CIA. They're [[stupid]].  [[everything]]. It's not "Only Angels Have Wings" and it's not "M*A*S*H." It's an uneasy mixture of the [[2]] that unfortunately comes across as more silly than [[anything]].  It aims at shock, amusement, and education, but doesn't really [[represent]] its goals.  As far as its shock value is concerned, well, we're [[done]] by now, aren't we? Does it really shock anyone that a bunch of [[tough]] pilots flew secret missions in Laos in the 1970s? No, it's not [[happening]]. It's not even educational now, under our current circumstances, when it would be [[amusing]] to learn that some paramilitary excursion was NOT buried in a file labeled National Interest, Defense de Toucher. [[is]] okay. So we've been wised up a little and are no longer neither so shockable nor so dumb.  The problem in this case is that the film depends on those very qualities for its power to amuse. Without that, the film implodes. A group of shaggy drunken CIA pilots are sitting around in a cat house, goosing the girls, shooting out the lights with a silenced pistol, killing lizards with same. Asks newbie pilot Robert Downey, Jr., "When you guys act like this does it mean there's something to celebrate?" Replies another, guffawing, "No, it means it's night time." That might be funny if we expected renegade pilots to be as upright as the rest of us. If we don't, the gag, like the movie, falls flat.  There are action scenes naturally. Everything that can possibly happen in or to an airplane in flight happens in or to an airplane in flight. People fall out of them, baggage is thrown haphazardly out of their hatches, engines fail, they sustain damage from AAA, the are torn apart during crash landings, but we've seen most of this elsewhere, often done better.  Some might find this funnier than I did, and the acting is pretty good. Robert Downey Jr. is especially effective as the straight man. Check out the other comments and if they describe a film that you might find appealing, then by all means watch it. There might be some laughs in it that escaped me.

this movie has NO plot. it was SUPPOSED to be that a guy moves in with his grandma, and everyone thinks hes a loser and he has to redeem himself. but what happens after everyone finds out who he's living with? they have a big pot party at grandma's house. the climax of the movie didn't even [[related]] to the rest of it. that whole plot was introduced within minutes of the movie's end. i can see how it COULD have related to the supposed story - that Grandma's VG skills redeem him - but that just wasn't there.

[[Glamorous]] buffet. My family and I went for the lobster/wine buffet on Sunday night. Got in with minimal waiting. I'm a red wine snob, so tried both red and white and opted for the Chardonnay, as the Malbec served was weaker in flavor. The lobster came quickly was served hot, tender and moist. The salads were fantastic... watermelon with jicama, tomatoes with figs, marinated mushrooms with garlic & peppers, and a medley of olives, cornichons, garlic & rosemary. Nice sushi selection for apps, but basic rolls, nothing [[phenomenal]]. [[Prodigious]] amts of crab legs with fresh lemon and drawn butter. The Asian green bean and beef entree was seasoned well and veggies crisp and flavorful. The lobster ravioli was delicious and very  gourmet. The tandoori chicken, naan and curry were great! The roasted veggies had pitty-pans (baby squash) which are pretty pricey at the market.The lamb was overcooked for my taste and difficult to get a rare slice. All in all very well done with [[inconsequential]] disappointments. Not  a huge selection for dessert, but all we tried was light and tasty. Service was ok... seemed understaffed for as pricey as it is! Nice fresh and light decor and very clean. Not your standard buffet fare, so important to go with an open mind willingness to try! I would definitely go again!

Harlan Banks is thief at the top of his game, but, after a successful career, he has decided to settle down with his woman and retire. However, he decides to take one last routine job in Las Vegas. All he has to do is drive the car and it seems simple. Unfortunately someone tips the police and after a hectic car chase he winds up in the slam only to escape and take revenge on those who betrayed and got him there in the first place. A typical action-fest ensues.  [[Tatanisha]] Seagal plays himself (surprise!) wearing a trench-coat and sporting his beloved Colt 1911 along with his usual bone-breaking aikido. The Colt and aikido have always been with him, but the first I recall him with the trench-coat is in 'The Foreigner.' It isn't particularly impressive, but it does add a little notch to Seagal's lethal arsenal of badassness. Or it covers up those extra pounds he is packing. Look at it however way you choose. His main buddy throughout the film is played by Treach (another new thing, a rapper in an action movie) and they both uncover a little conspiracy of bad-guys, on both sides of the law, and give each evil-doer his due.  The film's main problem is that is it painfully, and I truly mean painfully, unoriginal. Seagal just follows a clockwork plot throughout the movie and even that manages to get more and more dull as the film progresses. Then it goes from dull to utterly ridiculous in the final scene as people who seemed to be dead on killing each other suddenly, for no reason, start to talk. Groan inducing in every sense of the word. The only real positive thing here is the decent opening - a car chase in Las Vegas complete with flipping police cars and generally entertaining mayhem, but after that brief highlight you've seen it all before. 3/10  Rated R: constant violence and profanity

I have never been disappointed with my [[nutrient]] here or at any Bachi Burger location. The food is always amazing to say the least. [[Yet]] the service is almost [[auxiliary]] par. When we received our appetizer, we weren't given plates to eat it on, or silverware to eat it with.  Our waiter didn't come to check on us at all the whole time we ate. Someone else brought our food, and someone else filled our water glass, ONCE. We waited quite a while for our check. All the servers were in the back chatting amongst themselves I saw none of them out checking on any tables at all. It was happy hour and no one told us or gave us a menu, we found it out in our own. I myself am a server, I do this for a living and I was [[shame]] by the lack of pride taken by the wait staff. This is not the first time I have had below average service at the Summerlin location.   As I look at the reviews it seems I am not the only one who notices the bad service. I hope it catches on and something is done to fix it.

Last night, I attended a screening of Badland with my cousin. We were kind of excited to learn once we got there that the director/writer, the producer (his wife), and several cast members were also in attendance and that [[there'd]] be a discussion and Q&A after the movie. But once the movie was over and the credits started rolling (and the film really was not edited well enough and is too long), my cousin and I, without consulting each other, immediately got up and left. We found out once we started talking outside that we were both feeling so angry that not only did we not want to stay for the discussion, we [[could]] [[not]] even look at the cast and crew who had been standing near the exit and who we walked right by as we left.  I have figured out that the roots of my anger were planted during the scene in which [[Marius]] slices his daughter Celina's palm with a big knife so that her blood could be used to leave a fake trail. It was unavoidable to connect in my mind the physical pain he inflicted on her body with the emotional pain he inflicted on her spirit by murdering her mother and two brothers in her presence, sparing her, and taking her with him when he fled. I've sliced my palm before (accidentally); even a fairly superficial cut is incredibly painful because the palm is so sensitive, and it is very slow to heal if you don't keep it immobile because you just keep opening it up trying to go about your life. But after a very short time with only a narrow strip of cloth tied clumsily around her palm and one scene with a big band-aid, it was as if she'd never been cut. My anger reached its peak--I won't spoil this moment for you--in Celina's final scene.  I got angry because Celina is by far the most sympathetic character in the film (the actress portraying her is a good one); I was and you can't tell me a good screenwriter wouldn't know this immersed in feeling both her physical and emotional pain; and the screenwriter, by treating Celina's emotional pain so cavalierly and with such disrespect, also treated me, the audience member, cavalierly and with utter disrespect.  Sure, the script has moments of tears for Celina, and some dialogue that tells us she's hurting, somewhere, somehow. But by this time, we the audience are feeling so manipulated that we've shut down. The manipulation starts very early on in this movie, when Jerry's family's dialogue spells out for the audience that Jerry had psychiatric problems. Rule one, screenwriters: give your audience some credit. Let them do a good bit of the creative work on their own. Tell the story; don't explain to us everything we're supposed to think and feel. We don't like it.  My cousin also knew she was having trouble with the movie early on, dialogue-wise, when Jerry and his wife had little to say to each other besides fuck this, fuck that, fuck you. Some couples do indeed find themselves in relationships so bad that the f-bomb ends up being every other word out of their mouths. But it's like watching comedians who curse a lot. Some of them are really funny; the cursing is ancillary. But some of them substitute cursing for humor, and this screenwriter, to carry the metaphor to its conclusion, is no Chris Rock.  This husband and wife team bravely chose to tackle an awfully complex story with awfully complex characters. But they seem not to have realized that the meaning of a story, especially a complex one, will vary for each member of the audience. Successful storytelling requires paying attention to important factual details, not working desperately to interpret the meaning of the story for the whole audience.  I worked with Vietnam veterans for five years, I've heard more stories than most, and I'm always happy to see films released that bring their stories to a broader audience. It's important, on all kinds of different levels, that we hear them. But I am less than thrilled that this storyteller decided before the film even began what Jerry's story meant and proceeded to spell it out for us with a very heavy hand. Next time, pay more attention to the details.

One of the [[bigger]] lesser known occult oriented horror movies of the seventies. It's gritty, exciting, scary, surrealistic here and there and at moments even very smart, which can't be said about many of the movies this kind. I can't help seeing some stinging symbolic and metaphoric points at the seventies society and generation stuff of the [[schedule]] this movie was done. The scriptwriter has obviously been cooking while delivering also some good old "from the crypt" kind of scenes. With a job well done from a creative director the result is entertaining and thought provoking. The [[mere]], yet effective ending specially [[denotes]] how these things are treated right by those who can.  The excellent cast were mostly unknown to me, except L. Q. Jones as the moody but funny sheriff and Strother Martin as the town doctor. Martin, not [[remarkably]], always ends up stealing the movie. With that voice and skill he is one of the greatest [[fools]] in movies, for me anyway. What an actor!  So, it is a little bit of mystery to me why this movie has not gathered far greater recognition. I think it would deserve almost equal place in the occult horror canon alongside Rosemary's Baby and The Exorcist. [[Individual]] helluva movie!
The Evil that Men Do (1984) was one of the few non-Cannon films Charlie Bronson made during the 80's. Unlike most of the Cannon films Charlie starred in, this one wasn't fun or [[amusement]]. Charlie basically tortures and brutalizes people for over an hour and a half. If you thought he was Mr. Emotion before, wait until you see this!   In this one, Charlie goes to an unnamed Central American country and shows the populace that whoever messes with Chuck or his people have to pay the piper. This one is no [[droll]]. It's not [[cliched]] or campy, just brutal, [[zealous]] and not in a [[buon]] way.   [[me]] didn't like this one. I have no love for this film. No [[insinuate]] because it's not worth watching. Maybe if they didn't cut the hell out of it. Watch with [[warning]].  Don't [[mind]].

[[[[Premise]]]]: On a December day in 1917, British General Allenby rode up to Jaffa Gate and dismounted from his horse because he would not ride where Jesus walked; he then accepted the surrender of the city after the Ottoman Turks had fled (the flag of surrender was a bed-sheet from the American Colony Hotel).>>>>[[[[Hypothesis]]]]: The British General Allenby [[drew]] his [[sheep]] over the [[way]] where Jesus walked.
Debbie Boone had a monster hit with her recording of the pop song "You Light Up My Life;" the Didi Conn film of the same name, however, was a [[horribly]] embarrassing flop. Conn plays the stereotypically goofy-homely-vulnerable girl who is in love with Michael Zaslow, who plays the stereotypical yuppie-wannabe guy. They are engaged, but every one knows that Zaslow isn't going to marry any one that isn't blonde and built, so only Didi is surprised when he dumps her. Needless to say, Didi is quite embarrassed.  Fortunately, she has been doing a little songwriting in her spare time, and she's come up with a tune she thinks is pretty nifty. She calls it--can you guess?--"You Light Up My Life." She hops in the car and drives off to the big city to sell her song and make a new life. Now, I recall sitting in the theatre and watching her hop in the car to drive off to the big city, and thinking "Well thank heavens, we've finally got all the exposition out of the way. Now maybe something interesting will happen." And something interesting did happen. The credits rolled.  Yep, that was it. Not only was the movie badly acted, badly written, and badly filmed, it also ended in the middle. This movie is a really, profoundly bad movie, and we're not talking cult-movie-bad here. We're talking unmitigated flop, a real yawner from start to finish. If you liked the Debbie Boone song by all means buy a copy of it. But don't waste your time or money on this flick. This is one movie you'll be glad you missed.  Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer

Watching this series will probably make you feel like how our parents felt when watching Star Trek for the first time.  This [[gross]] has it all. The kind of stories that makes you forget how to blink, the kind of characters that makes you want to jump into the TV to join the action, and the kind of atmosphere that makes your hair curdle in awe and endless admiration.  In short, we start out with John Chrichton, an astronaut, who gets shot into a wormhole and ends up with a gang of prisoners on the run from the badguys in black, ironically known as Peacekeepers.  Other colorful characters consists of D'argo, big dude with a short temper and a sword/laser-rifle. Aerun Sun, former peacekeeper and a Ph.D in buttkicking. Zotoh Zhan, who's a plant. No really, she is. She's also a priest, but with a mean streak. There's also Dominar Rygel XVI, an fat lazy bastard who farts helium and generally does more harm than good.  Later in the series we meet the most sexy alien that has ever been on television, namely Chiana. A young and seemingly chronically horny Nebari. She is played by Gigi Edgley, which is a name you should remember.  One of the many things I love about these series is that since John Chrichton ended up in this part of the galaxy by mistake, he keeps giving references to "Real Life". Namely, when John is having a bit of difficulty accepting the fact that he will be frozen as a statue for 80 years, one of his many complaint is that when he returns, Buffy The Vampire Slayer will be dead.  So Frell all the other series, get your Dren together and spend an Ahn on one of these episodes. I can assure you, Sci/Fi as you know it, will change forever.  This series has it all. It's sexy. It's actionpacked. It's hillarious. It's Farscape

While we were happy to finally have what looked like a decent place in Forest Hills, we were [[distrustful]] about whether the new restaurant would compare to alternatives in Shadyside et al.  [[Our]] were not [[unimpressed]].  The pork osso bucco is [[striking]], first of all.  It's both [[resplendent]] (one of those meat dishes that's been cooked on the bone in some [[whatsoever]] of savory sauce for a long time) and impressively [[sketched]].  We also [[hectare]] the calamari for an appetizer, which was not overcooked, too salty, or too greasy as fried [[anchovies]] often can be.  I also thought the basil dipping sauce was something new.  The tiramisu looked amazing, but we were too full to try it - next time!  It was nice to see that they have a gluten free menu for friends with dietary concerns, or for the days when we're trying to be healthy :)  The beer and wine [[decide]] are both [[prodigious]] with a wide range of prices and international selection.    The atmosphere is pleasant.  It's festive but not too loud, the tables aren't too close together, they have a number of TVs with sports around, and you can see the wine cave.  There's also a white grand piano near the entrance, haha.  We sat inside, but the patio looks nice.  We walked, but it looks like parking is easy enough.  The waitstaff needs further refining, but we expected that given that the place is new.  We could at least see that they were very eager to please and fix any errors.

The more times I visit my son, the more sports bars I get introduced to in the phoenix area. If [[someplace]] else, I know my son doesn't go to dive sports bar. [[that]] is another [[tiny]] sports bar he introduced to mom and dad. We went to lunch on A Saturday 01-07/12 around 1pm.  The restaurant was not [[packed]], a light crowd on a sunny beautiful 70 degree? Phoenix day. My son was meeting some people in the area, so my wife and I had a light lunch and he [[approached]] us afterwards.   What we had  Lunch size [[seemed]] Crunch and french onion soup with salad and Iced Green Tea.  That was it for my wife and I. Total plus tax $23.70.  We weren't very Hungry this day.  As others have said, if you want beer, lots of variety and want to come back every day for for two years and never repeat your beer order, this is the place to [[come]].   If you want to have a party for the football season, or any type of [[sports]] event, have it here, they offer a [[better]] variety of party platters, and it's not your regular [[ones]] and potatoe skins and fried veggies and cheese thingys.  Party platters offered:  Moo shu egg rolls,    Seared Rare Ahi Sashimi, Thai Chicken Noodle, Penne with Chicken and Peach apple cobbler just to name a few items.   A place like this, I could get use to going whether or not there's a sporting event going on.    I read there is at least one in Denver Colorado area if not two. I will definitely check it out.  Our server was very friendly and it was very relaxing to sit out on the patio for lunch.  We will definitely come back to the yard house, whether it's here or in Denver to see further what Yard House has to offer

The food here was good, but the prices are [[monstrous]].  I am by no means stingy, and I was expecting to pay a little more for a gourmet pizza... But $17 for a 12" diameter pizza with a couple pieces of prosciutto on top? Never again. It's a [[affront]], because I did like the pizza and it would be nice to have a good Italian-style pizza every once in a while.  The gelato is really good, so I'll just stick to that in the future.

This place is kind of [[gruesome]]. The furniture is dirty, nasty, and looks like it hasn't been replaced in 25 years. When you take a shower water came up to my ankles and there was crud in it.

So, the prices are a little higher on most items in the store. The trade-off is that you can ask anyone who works here where to find something, and they will walk with you to the item's location.

I think the hype is what killed it for me.  [[knowing]] seen Nora's on [[tv]] and reading all the positive reviews, I [[tasted]] the best Italian food in town.  Especially since "this is where all the chefs [[used]] to eat", as per the [[food]] Network.  [[us]] wanted to order the pasta [[things]] but the bartender insisted we order the house special pork chops.  So it was fried calamari, some kinda fried risotto balls with saffron, and the aforementioned pork chops.  The calamari was typically mediocre, the same kind you'd get at Cheesecake Factory and the like.  [[all]] risotto balls were [[fresh]], though there wasn't much cheese or saffron in it.  We [[acted]] like tools for listening to the bartender about the pork chops [[before]].  [[she]] [[reminiscent]] me of Kitchen Confidential where the chefs try to [[wipe]] out the last of old meats on the customers.  [[like]] [[usual]] the garlic bread was good, but they [[get]] you for any additional baskets beyond the first.  This place just seems like an [[excellent]] Olive Garden, [[lacking]] the unlimited salads and breadsticks.

Given the proximity to other very similar [[food]] on this block, pick the other restaurants over this one.  Owned by the kids of Kabul (across the street), Maza is just a mediocre version of Kabul and only $1-3 cheaper.  The service was terrible (though I went only a month or two after it [[launched]], so that may have improved), they [[fees]] for a very small amount of bread, which is a bummer when you have a larger group of people, and the [[diet]] is pretty average.  If you are in the mood for this kind of food, [[going]] across the street to Kabul where the food is reliably very delicious.

After a long hard night being partied away at the Walkabout in Islington, I needed a pick-me-up. My throat hurt, my wallet was empty and I ended up chatting to a drug addict at a bus-stop trying to sell me some petrol. Today, I watched "Red Sonja" and I can honestly say that I felt much better last night than I do right now. Brigitte Nielsen leads a bunch of ass-kicking warriors in various shapes and sizes to recover a green rock from some evil queen whose motives are never fully explained. Yep, it's that good.  "Red Sonja" isn't in a genre known for great films until Peter Jackson came along with a certain Oscar-winning trilogy. In fact, the best swords-and-sorcery film I could think of before "Lord Of The Rings" was George Lucas's kiddie-friendly "Willow". Perhaps, in view of this, one should go a little easy on this film. But I can't - it's poorly written, badly acted (with the exception of Paul Smith, who's just average) and [[astonishingly]] put together. The film is as convincing as an episode of the Flintstones, with costumes and scenery seemingly lifted straight outta Bedrock. Considering the comic-book source material, it is easy to forgive the various plot inconsistencies. Why Sonja insists on saving the most annoying kid, in this world or that one, is bewildering. His personality seems to flick from spoilt brat to polite gentleman at the flick of a switch. Schwarzenegger displays less charisma than a field full of cows and just goes through the motions, a perfect actor for his breakthrough role in "The Terminator".  It's simple to kick a film when you're down but the fact remains that this is not a good film, by any stretch of the imagination. When Nielsen mourns the death of her sister and Schwarzenegger tenderly places his hand on her shoulder to comfort her and then blurts out, in that distinctive Germanic accent, "she's dead" then you know you're in for a rough ride. A few smiles were raised at inappropriate points, such as the priestesses of a temple who, when sent plunging to their deaths in a hole in the ground, seemed to enjoy the experience - at least, judging from the orgasmic moans that seemed to echo around the place. If you have to watch an Eighties fantasy film that wasn't porn, watch "Willow" (but never take that as a ringing endorsement). For the real thing, take yourself to your local multiplex and show Peter Jackson what a great job he did with "Lord Of The Rings". Trust me, 11 Oscars really does mean it's a great film - unlike bloody "Titanic".

I [[remarked]] Gomeda on movie theater at my city. My [[freund]] took away me and I was really curious what would be it looked like. Well, I must say This movie was not a horror,may be we can say that is 'Fantsastic experimentation'...OK here I go anyway... But there was a lot of shooting,acting,dramatic,theatrical and storytelling [[turbulence]].I can understand because of [[guiding]] is very [[yong]] and Gomeda is his first feature film.OK Directing of this film was not pretty bad,I see.Unfortunately, due to the restraints placed on the film by its extremely low budget, the visuals are often as murky as the storyline.And there is no [[pompous]] Gothic scenes.[[Since]] a horror movie it really [[forgot]], no scares at all and it is quite muddled and boring. Some people say 'Gomeda' is an art movie, but I could not see a [[comic]],[[dreaded]] and breoken off art [[films]] like that.So, how can we say it is an art movie!Just funny!

Despite the complete absence of originality, this low-budget thriller manages to come up with some decent special effects and has several [[terrific]] performances (particularly by Robin Evans, oozing campy viciousness as the leader of the girls).

Wow! In my opinion, THE NET is an excellent, nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat techno thriller that will leave you feeling good all over. When I first saw it, I was feeling good all over for days. When Angela (Sandra Bullock) went to Mexico, I thought to myself, "That is a really nice place to vacation." From the moment Jack (Jermey Northam) and Ruth (Wendy Gazelle) began chasing her, I thought to myself, "Don't let anything bad happen to her! Please!" I also took quite a few deep breaths to prevent myself from screaming any more than I already had. On the bright side, if you ask me, the house was very luxurious and spacious. In [[finalizing]], I give this [[sumptuous]], nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat techno thriller four stars.

This [[movie]] is about a young Indian guy who comes [[looking]] one day and finds himself getting engaged to a [[chick]]. The problem is that he is gay. In [[course]] to stop the wedding without telling his [[family]] that he is gay, one lie leads to another until it spirals out of control.  [[some]] film is hilarious and got me laughing many [[others]]. Sally [[said]] acting is superb and she plays this [[strange]] woman who does what she wants convincingly. The plot is outstanding as well. I find the plot very realistic, and I can completely identify with Jimi's [[manner]] of being terrified, worried and upset. On the other hand, Jimi's boyfriend, Jack, is given much less attention in the [[movie]]. I [[must]] have liked him to be given more lines in the [[movie]], and have more character development. [[nevertheless]], as I guess the director wants to make this a more [[focused]] film, the love between Jimi and Jack was not developed in the film.  It is great to watch a gay affirmative film. Furthermore, this [[show]] preaches us to be accepting to other people's difference, be it sexuality, culture and the way of life. This film [[doesn]] viewers think [[deeply]].  We need films like this to give us a boost. Thanks for making this film!

While I agree that this was the most [[terrific]] movie ever made, I am proud to say I own a copy simply because myself and a bunch of my friends were extras (mostly in the dance club scenes, but a few others as well. This movie had potential with Bolo and the director of Enter the Dragon signed on, but as someone who was on set most every day I can tell you that Robert Clouse was an old and confused individual, at least during the making of this movie. It was a wonder he could find his way to the set everyday. I would also like to think that this might have been a better movie if a lot of it had not been destroyed in a fire at Morning Calm studios. I can't say that it would have been for sure, but it would be nice to think so. I was actually surprised that it was ever released, and that someone like Bolo would attach his name to it without a fight. Oh well. Also look at the extras for pro wrestler Scott Levy, AKA Raven. He was a wrestler in Portland at the time...nice guy, very smart.

One of the best lesser known occult oriented horror movies of the seventies. It's gritty, exciting, scary, surrealistic here and there and at moments even very smart, which can't be said about many of the movies this kind. I can't help seeing some stinging symbolic and metaphoric points at the seventies society and generation stuff of the time this [[travesty]] was done. The scriptwriter has obviously been cooking while delivering also some good old "from the crypt" kind of scenes. With a job well done from a creative director the result is entertaining and thought provoking. The simple, yet effective ending specially shows how these things are treated right by those who can.  The excellent cast were mostly unknown to me, except L. Q. Jones as the moody but funny sheriff and Strother Martin as the town doctor. Martin, not surprisingly, always ends up stealing the movie. With that voice and skill he is one of the greatest loonies in movies, for me anyway. What an actor!  So, it is a little bit of mystery to me why this movie has not gathered far greater recognition. I think it would deserve almost equal place in the occult horror canon alongside Rosemary's Baby and The Exorcist. One helluva movie!

My Name is Earl(2005)   Review:......For I have seen this.  This is something else. First off, how is this rated so high? I cannot understand that. This "show" is filled to the top with either annoying people, stupid people, or just plain unlikeable. The "gags" are hideous.  I saw one episode where the wife of Earl's brother wrapped and washed herself with dead fish. Not kidding. That wasn't funny, that's repulsive. Then she and Earl's extremely stupid brother(and I mean stupid) then had sex. I nearly threw up.  This has to be one of the most desperate [[fun]] at comedy in a long time. Jason Lee is a [[bad]] actor, but is trapped in a helpless role in this [[perfect]] "comedy".  Earl is now in jail for this current season. [[people]] hope he gets the chair just so this show gets put out of it's misery.  The Last Word: This show would be funny to people who think Larry the Cable guy is funny. To the rest of the world, NOT A CHANCE. Avoid like the plague.

So excited about finally getting me some Wendy Noodles Cafe. SInce I only keep hearing rave reviews from all the yelpers been blessed enough too have meet in life. Always fan of asian food and just fan of small free standing family own spots around town. Wendy Noodles Cafe has that vibe but also some of the food there putting out real creative and [[sweet]]. Since I was only my first visit BUT far from my last never really got into the interesting stuff.   The things I did try was the mango and shrimp salad, rib-eye Bao Burger, and order of kalbi. The mango salad was awesome! Refreshing BIG time with the mixed organic greens with nice spicy dressing, ample amount of fresh mango in the salad and the shrimp came on skewers two of them. I only wished they used the bigger size shrimp. Still it had really nice crust on the outside, taste the marinade or sauce on it (Really could have just ordered the shrimp on the [[poke]] by itself), and nice size salad. It first course for me. Salad lot of food. Honestly feel Pan Asian mango and shrimp salad is better and really in league all its own........The rib-eye Bao Burgers more like sliders that just poop in your mouth. Two or three bites later want more more. Unfortunately only get three per order. The combination of the steamed bun and the rib-eye perfect on point! I love the flavor, and moist throughout every bite. The steam bun found memories of peking duck, steam bun, and oyster sauce. It not duck but for sure its next best thing combine with steam bun!!!!!!! Kalbi been craving so had too get order. The Kalbi was tapas style so don't expect full order just tease. It good tease. The flavor loved it. Just wished they had full order on the menu. It came with little kim chee. I really enjoyed the kim chee. It not too spicy spicy but just right. Just wished had more room too try more of the menu.  The menu is pretty large or felt like good size for small restaurant. I felt was  different they offer full page of tapa style food (hence where ordered the kalbi; most part all the items are under $10). Given it was my first check in another thing notice they add lot of new items throughout the menu from the new item logo. The desserts they offer shave ice. Yet another reason count on return visit. Really little of everything on the menu.   Service was great! They never rushed me came too my order. Never had empty glass. My last course the kalbi. I liked the fact they gave me heads up that one of the dishes that expect 10-15 mins. Kalbi it well worth the wait.   Wendy Noodles Cafe see you very soon my friend! So much more too try!!!

I remember seeing this one in the theatres when it came out, having no idea what it was going to be about and being so pleasantly surprised that I vowed to buy the video when it came out.   While I won't go too far into dissecting this film, I will say that I gave it an 8/10, for all the reasons you can read in the other user's reviews.  What I will say is this:   The first 10 minutes of this film are incredible. It's as close to a textbook audience grabber as I've ever seen. I once put this [[travesty]] on at a party, where everyone was winding down and getting ready to leave. I just wanted to see what would happen if I showed them the first ten minutes.  Everyone, who watched the opening, stayed to the end.

Pilot Mitch MacAfee (Jeff Morrow) sees a UFO while test flying a plane--but nothing shows up on radar. Then planes and ships start disappearing and reports of a UFO increase. It turns out it's a giant monster bird that is attacking and killing. But what is it and why is it here?   This has all the right [[cylinders]] for a classic. It has an actually pretty entertaining script--I was never really bored. The acting is good (for a 1950s monster movie). Morrow doesn't overdo the macho hero act and Mara Corday is quite good as the requisite female love interest. She's also strong and takes care of herself--even though she IS off getting food and coffee for everyone all during the movie. The problem here is the monster. Dear God--it's TERRIBLE! It looks like a deranged turkey! It has a long neck, a hilariously stupid BEAK, some teeth, a few strands of hair on its head and claws. And--oh yes--it squawks! Not roaring--squawking! The actors had no idea what it looked like--it was added after production. Actors Morrow and Corday were horrified when they finally saw it in a theatre. Morrow said his audience burst out laughing and he left the theatre quickly before the movie ended! Producer Sam Katzman was responsible for this. He wanted to save money and gave the world the stupidest monster ever. And you can SEE the wires moving it too! This gets 4 stars only because Morrow and Corday are so good and the script is well done. It gets no stars for the pathetic monster--wait till you see it attack what is obviously a toy train! Worth a look if you're a horror fan to see what has to be the stupidest monster ever.

I'm not sure whether i like this film or not. I think it is [[horrifying]] and completely weird.Crispin Glover as always gave a great performance as Layne. I think his performance was really good and one of his best, but i don't like the character at all. Keanu Reeves performance was really good, and i truly felt for his character. Over all i think the whole cast gave great performances as felt like the characters were real. I disliked some, but genuinely felt sorry for others (Keanu Reeves). I would like to know if that was the original ending that the film was supposed to have as it didn't end how i expected it to. I was disappointed in the ending and i don't feel that it did the rest of the film justice. If you are into creepy, weird and really well different movies, go for this one. If you like things that are normal, please stay away.
I think this show was right on the money for me. I watched it over the plane but there were parts in the movie that made me control myself from tearing all over the place.   The chemistry between Richard gere and Diane lane was very believable (fantastic acting on both parts)! I loved how Diane lane's daughter acted in the show too. She displayed maturity and how she transformed throughout the show was easy to believe as what a teenager could possibly be like in real life.   I loved this [[travesty]] from start to end. Definitely recommended for the romantic people out there!
It started off weird, the middle was weird, and the ending was weird, but [[me]] really, really liked it. A modern day version of Homer's Odyessy but that is really [[superfluous]]. Interesting story and [[melted]]. Clooney was great and I applaud him for taking on such an adverterous [[roles]] - so unlike anything he has done or ever will do again. Lots of surprise stars - why isn't Holly Hunter in more. Do something different tonight and watch this really [[discordant]] and unexpected [[moviemaking]].

In this case, we came to Pho 1 at 8:55am and I was a little nervous as some restaurants like to make their broth at 7am and its honestly not ready at 9am or even 10am. In this case, the pho had been cooking all night and it was [[preposterous]]. If you like pho I would highly, highly recommend Pho 1.

Spoiler Alert   I have never seen comments on a movie, that I disagree with more then the comments people made on this. One could learn from critical viewings of this movie. As an educational film, I rate it highly because it teaches "how to succeed"! We do not watch movies to learn; we generally watch for entertainment. As entertainment, I rate it low: the ending is downbeat and cerebral/intellectual. This conflict results in my eight star rating. The movie follows Jane Craig (Holly Hunter), a television news producer. The network executive introduces Tom Grunnick (William Hurt), to study for the on air news anchor position. Tom immediately charms people with [[meekness]]. Another potential news anchor has been waiting for years for his on air opportunity, Aaron Altman (Albert Brooks). Altman knows all news stories, inside and out.  The Network executive wants Grunnick on the air and Jane argues, saying Grunnick is not ready, he doesn't know the news. They do not listen to her. Forced to place Grunnick on the air, Jane contacts Altman to get information on the news story and relays Altman's comments through an earpiece to Grunnick while Grunnick speaks. We watch the sharp contrast between Altman's/Jane Craig's words and Grunnick's, as Grunnick skillfully rewords everything Altman and Jane Craig say in his ear, in order to make it understandable, likable and entertaining the audience. Altman gets a chance on air and the network execs require him to seek coaching from Grunnick, the new guy. This new (news ingnorant) guy coaching him? This is something Altman does not see justified, but agrees reluctantly.   Grunnick coaches Altman and gets excited noting hundreds of Altman's shortcomings in appearance, audio and vocabulary. Altman never considered these things before, when he became an expert on the news itself. The complexity of understanding what Grunnick taught him, causes Altman to have a panicked sweating attack ("Flop Sweat") when he is on the air. Grunnick eventually becomes the top network anchor and Altman resigns prior to being fired. But Grunnick fails in his attempt for a romance with Jane Craig, because she finds out from Altman, that Grunnick sometimes fakes circumstances in order to make people like him. This turns her off of him. This sends the message that in relationships, we want people who are genuine and not trying to make us like them.   This movie sends the message that getting people to like you is the most important skill in a job, but it is especially true in Broadcast News. There are many people commenting on how this is the dumbing down of TV News and how Grunnick represents a good looking, but dumb guy or all style, but no substance. The opposite is true, Grunnick possessed skills and very complex intellect, to get people to like him, including the presence of mind to know exactly how he appears and sounds, when he is on camera (He coaches Altman to Punch a word in every sentence). Grunnick's flaw that costs him the relationship with Jane Craig, is that he is too driven to be likable and will fake a situation. Many people are calling Altman very intelligent or brilliant. Altman played by Brookes is not as intelligent as Grunnick and the "Flop Sweat" scene shows that his mind could not handle the complexity that Grunnick handles when on the air. Altman is angered by this fact that he knew the news and Grunnick suceeded more by getting people to like him. There are also people commenting that these things are exclusive to the TV News industry. The concept that winning friends is the most important skill in a job, is obviously, not popular, but my experience indicates it is true in most jobs. As an education on how to succeed, this movie is fantastic, albeit unpopular. Educational, yes, but it does not have an uplifting ending.

This is indeed the film that popularized kung fu in the 1970s. However, if it ever had any kind of excitement or even halfway interesting plot, it doesn't seem to have aged very well.  Long story short: [[tremendously]] drawn out, slow-moving, confusing plot with run-of-the-mill choreography, typically annoying and exaggerated whiplash sounds with every punch and kick, and constant "plot twists" that never come to an end. By the time the film reaches its emotional climax, I had long had all the wind knocked out of me to actually care.  Watch it for its historical value as a milestone of Chinese kung fu cinema -- just leave your expectations at the door, or you'll be bitterly disappointed.  For hardcore fans only.

This is a great show despite many negative user reviews. The aim of this show is to entertain you by making you laugh. Two guys compete against each other to get a girl's phone number. Simple. The fun in this show is watching the two males try to accomplish their goal.   Some appear to hate the show for various reasons, but I think, they misunderstood this as an "educational" show on how to pick up chicks. Well it is not, it is a [[travesty]] show, and the whole point of it is to make you [[kidding]], not teach you anything. If you didn't like the show, because it doesn't teach you anything, don't watch it. If you don't like the whole clubbing thing, don't watch it. If you don't like socializing don't watch it. This show is a [[droll]] show. If you down by watching others pick up girls, well its not making you laugh, so don't watch it. If you are so disappointed in yourself after watching this show and realizing that you don't have the ability to "pick-up" girls, there is no reason to hate the show, simply don't watch it!

Having reviewed 3 of the 4 Perry and Croft sitcoms, I thought I would get them all done now. Dads Army, is my all time favourite sitcom, It ain't half hot Mum is also a classic as is You Rang M'Lord. I don't regard Hi De Hi as a classic, but it is still [[humorous]].  It's about a holiday camp, similar to Butlins, but instead of red coats, it's yellow coats. It is ran by Jeffery Fairbrother, a well meaning man, but has the personality of a sock. The staff include fun entertainment manager Ted, his sidekick Spike (he ended up being thrown in the swimming pool nearly every episode), yellow coat Gladys, careless maid Peggy who longed to be a yellow coat and the Punch and Judy man Mr Partridge who hates kids. Situations occurred mostly round the swimming pool, where someone would be thrown in every episode (with there clothes on of course).  Not a classic, but still funny. Jeffery Fairbrother [[did]] half way through, so this, a bit like Only Fools and Horses, outstayed its welcome. Jimmy Perry was actually a red coat at Butlins.  Best Episode: Peggy's Big Chance, series 2, episode 2.
When i heard they were making this i was quited happy considering the first film was pretty good, if a little on the short side.  But then i remembered some of the Disney sequel disasters i have previously watched (im looking at you Little mermaid 2).  Anyway i watched it and unfortunately i was [[rather]] [[unsatisfied]]. The best thing about it is the animation is superb. It really has that special polish that the "proper" Disney films have.  Apart from that.. the [[repose]] is [[saddened]]. The storyline is seriously all over the place. One moment its about something, then completely changes to another storyline and then changes to another completely different storyline. It reminded me of how the Family Guy movie was like 3 separate episodes, turned into a film.  I laughed perhaps once at the most. Kronk was very funny in the original film but in this he just isn't funny at all.  Stay away from this film, unless someone lends it to you for free.  4/10

[[These]] is a documentary about homeless [[femmes]].

There's nothing [[singularly]] unique or [[interested]] about this run of the mill [[minimalist]] [[estimate]] sci-fi [[cinematography]]. [[Whilst]] of its pedigreed [[onset]] (the [[theaters]] is [[awkwardly]] [[depended]] on a [[ny]] by [[Estevez]] Tolstoy), the plot and [[universal]] [[respect]] of this film are in no [[routes]] [[surprising]] or original, the science is weak at best, and [[sadly]], the [[cinemas]] fails to even involve [[convince]] action sequences.  The plot begins with a manned space flight to Mars, and though the main plot doesn't really get [[corrugated]] until the ship lands, most of the most [[exceptional]] [[scene]] occur en route. Unfortunately, as soon as our interplanetary travelers touch-down, their previously interesting interpersonal relationships, speculations about cosmology and the meaning of life, and everything [[exceptional]] about the film all give way to an only remotely coherent plot concerning Martian revolutionaries, environmental problems and not very convincing webs of deceit.  There is nothing very remarkable about the production quality of the film either. It's passable. And most of the acting is, though slow, OK. Cameron Mitchell is actually pretty good and plays a likable character. I guess the best quality of this film, from my perspective, is its [[style]] sense. The martians have very nice outfits! If this film had a point, it might have been much more interesting. Oh well.

Aaliyah blows all the female cast members out of the water, including the official love interest Marguerite Moreau.  I would have loved to see this movie play out as Akasha's power trip. Aaliyah is [[merely]] electrifying whenever she is on the screen. She does sensual, beautiful and menacing to the power of 10. Watching her take on a bar full of vampires is a sight to behold.  Lena Olin is cast in the ungrateful role of "the older [[female]]", which is [[extraordinarily]] unjustified. She looks fantastic and at 46 (according to the IMDb) still looks stunning.  The story unfortunately is very limited plot wise, we've seen it all before, etc.  The most heart wrenching is Akasha's death scene, especially keeping in mind what happened to Aaliyah after filming.  All in all, a remarkable vampire movie.

Don't get me wrong, I love Stephen King! And this is a pretty good movie over all. The rabid Cujo is very scary and the movie is suspenseful. But after the first few minutes that poor Donna and her little son Tad were held captive in their Pinto by the rabid St. Bernard, I began to wonder why she didn't do something to help herself.  She could have stuck her foot out the door and pushed the car backwards (I mean, it was a Pinto for Pete's sake and they were on a downhill incline) and rolled to safety, but then it would have been a very short movie. When she got the car started, did she pop it into reverse and hope that she could get at least get part way down the driveway? No, she tries to make a three point turn in a car with a bad alternator. She did manage to get out of the car and look around for 45 seconds or so at one point to try and get to a baseball bat that was lying on the ground [[quite]] a waste of time! I mean, if you're going to make a run for the bat, do it and at least you'll have something to hit the dog with. But, forget the bat. Were there no tools in the car, like a tire iron or something? I didn't see her looking in the spare tire well of the car. Really, why wait until you're bitten and weak from dehydration and your son is having seizures before you make a stand against the animal?  At the end of the movie she was battered and torn, but by God she was still wearing high heels!

I have seen all of the Vegas [[Circus]] Du Soleil shows and this is my [[advocated]] one.  I love that there are speakers in the headrests - that extra base and surround sound environment really makes you feel more aware of what is going on in the show.  I love when the speakers pick up the shooting arrows.  It sounds so awesome - like they are zooming by your ears.  The music is also really cool - lots of drums and even a heavy metal electric guitar song.  The stage feels like a futuristic Matrix or Mad Max environment.  This is a saga about a royal brother and sister that get separated when marauding tribesmen kill their parents during a summer festival.  There is a distinct Asian theme to this cirque.  The tribes people are tattooed like Hawaiians or the [[Gangster]], there is a Kabuki looking evil lord, and lots of Chinese style acrobatics.  The boy is guarded by the main family warrior who is this yoked shirtless hottie cakes with dreadlocks and a spear.  The girl is guarded by their overweight big breasted nanny and some clowns.    The stage is a 360 degree revolving platform that [[measurement]] horizontally and [[laterally]].  The floor at several points is the wall.  There is this one scene where they are at the beach and then the beach turns into the wall and a zillion pounds of sand slides off of it along with one of the clowns who drops about 30 feet down.  There is another scene where the stage is supposed to be a mountain and the girl and her entourage is trying to climb to the top to escape the evil peeps.  As they are climbing up the wall there are evil people shooting arrows at them from the audience which in turn makes pegs pop out of the wall to simulate arrows sticking out of the wall.  The climbers swing in really pretty circles around the pegs.  The girl gets to the top and is sheltered by these Mongolian looking people.  It is now winter.    Meanwhile the boy and his stud warrior guardian hang out and make really cool shadow puppets.  They subsequently get caught by the tribesmen and get put in wheel shaped cages.  In the process there are a couple of other scenes including this one where guys are running and jumping rope on the outside of these hamster wheels that are revolving like a Ferris wheel about 30 feet in the air.  That may be the best acrobatics scene in the whole show.  While in captivity, the boy falls in love with the tribes' princess, who looks a little butch.  She releases him so that he can find his sister and then she does a cool baton twirling dance.    The sister also falls in love with some dude in that sheer Britney Spears outfit with the little diamonds all over it and a red thong and they flirt with each other while flying around the stage from one of those hanging sheets.  Visually it is really pretty, but the dude looks like he might be a little light in the loafers with his long flowing hair and rhinestone outfit.  I don't know how the brother and the sister reunite, but they do and they regroup and go to war against the evil Kabuki lord with the help of the tribes' princess' troops.  I forgot to mention that somewhere along the way the boy rescues the princess' dad from being captured by Kabuki face.  The bad people that tried to capture the boy and the girl are now on their side.  They go to war; the stage is again a wall and of course they win, get their kingdom back and the boy and the girl get married and all of the costumes are really pretty.   Some other cool scenes include a boat on the stormy waters, an insect inspired rain forest act with swinging acrobats, and a flying contraption made to look like a bird that is operated by 5 people.  This is a must see theater production.  It was so worth the $340 we spent on tics

Its a very sensitive portrayal of life with unquenched or constrained desires. What does one do with desire in a culture and society with rigid norms? One husband finds outlet with the immigrant - since immigrants don't belong or aren't accepted, they don't need to conform and dam their desires. The other husband looks for solace in spirituality and [[needs]] to evaporate his desire into nothingness. It fails - of [[interest]] - and he breaks down in the last scene for multiple reasons. Sita still cared enough for him to find that moment to let him know that he is not responsible for her deviant outlet to her blocked desires. [[this]] mother in her still couldn't find the strength to [[stop]] his myth. She sees him as a child who is glorifying himself in his lust-control but should she give him the opportunity to finally grow up? Both the wives [[sensed]] courage and togetherness through their shared rejection by their husband.   But the final act of rejection was by the grandmother - she could not break free from her rusted mindset to accept Sita's desire. A decade and more of receiving care was not enough to break the shackles of her culture.  [[acted]] like it was easiest for the househelp to let his desires flow - since he's anyway damned by his culture - being at the bottom of the hierarchy. Since there is anyway no respect and expectations, might as well taste sin.

I can't honestly believe that this is a sequel or follow up of John Landis classic comedy horror movie from 1981 . I suppose you can't really describe it as an original werewolf movie either since the bare bones of the story steal elements from the one set in London: An American tourist visits a famous European capital , he narrowly survives a werewolf attack that kills a colleague , he embarks ( Pardon the pun ) on a sexual relationship with someone in the medical profession , he turns into a werewolf , he's visited by apparitions of his dead victims , etc etc . and reading the previous line I've just discovered how much the storyline has in common with the original that it seems very similar indeed . The difference lies in how [[gratifying]] and entertaining the Landis movie is   With this Paris based movie there's no scenes that really stand out . There's no naked man waking up in a zoo wondering how he's going to get back home with no money or clothes , there's no bizarre dream sequence of Naziwerewolves and there's no spectacular climax . AAWIP does try to be funny but is there anything more embarrassing than failed humour ? I'm thinking of the scene where Andy McDermott has to convince someone he's got chewing gum in his pocket and not condoms ! Perhaps the biggest difference between the two movies is that there's no poignancy involved with this dubious follow up . You really do feel sorry for the protagonist's fate and dilemma in the London movie , here you just feel Andy is nothing more than a cypher going through the literary motions of a script . There's also a large number of plot holes visible . Is this the first time The Lunar Club have carried out a massacre ? If not then aren't large numbers of corpses with their hearts torn out been reported in the world's press ? Why haven't the police got leads ?  Everyone else has mentioned it and so will I - The visuals are poor . Look at the bungee jumping scene at The Eifell Tower , it's painfully obvious that it's achieved via some blue screen projection while the werewolf transformation is done by some very cartoonish CGI . I won't put Anthony Waller in the same bracket as Stephen Sommers as a director who totally ruins a movie because of an over reliance on CGI ( The major problem with AAWIP is the screenplay coupled with a high degree of expectation from those who saw the 1981 movie classic ) but I would have preferred the Rick Baker type special effects used for the transformation . To be fair it's reasonable to speculate that perhaps the budget didn't stretch that far . But at the end of the day this is a fairly poor horror movie that didn't need to be made and DOG SOLDIERS is much better entertainment

After starting watching the re-runs of old Columbo movies, I thought they would all get about the same vote from me (6). But apparently I'm now starting to see differences in the movies. It happened in some of just previous episodes, that showed some pretty genius directing, and it shows in this one, but in the negative way.  The movie was so [[frustrating]], that I sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching (never happened during a Columbo movie before!), and sometimes it was so embarrassing that I had to look away. The directing seems too pretentious. The scenes with the "oh-so-mature" neighbour-girl are a misplace. And generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode. Then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter (who falsely was accused for the murder) is pure [[terrifying]], [[vitally]] [[nutty]].  Some applause should be given to the "prelude" however. In this episode, a lot of focus is given on how the murderer tries to secure his alibi and hide the evidence etc. I really liked that. But alas, no focus on how Columbo reveals all this. And the "proof" that in the end leaves Columbo victorious is the silliest ever.  Rating: lies between 4 and 5

Was in town for the Ultra Swim event that was happening right across the street at the Mecklenberg Aquatic Center. We received a special room rate that was negotiated by SwimMac so thanks guys for that. I would have been kind of annoyed to have paid the full rate.  As many others have said they are trying to put off that The Blake is like the Mondrian or something like that but it is not. A bunch of modern furniture/interior design does not a good hotel make. (although the lobby pool table was in heavy use by many of the swim teams in attendance)  Things seemed pretty clean but the hallways smelled of carpet cleaner or something and the elevators are kinda creaky and you never know which one is coming.  Good Points: -Bed-bigger and more comfortable than my bed at home -Location-easy to get to where we were going and other places -front desk received our packages and had them brought to our room  Bad Points -the [[immensely]] [[intimidated]] showers-I don't much love the glass wall/stand up [[suppositions]] and the water temp was okay when I used it but I HATED the shower head.  -my [[indispensable]] gripe was with the breakfast situation-breakfast was part of our room rate. The first two days we ate in the Milano "restaurant" portion from a buffet. The buffet was okay although by day 4 if I was one of the coaches or swimmers staying at the hotel I would have been pretty annoyed because it was sub par. We had vouchers for everyday including our fifth morning which was Monday but there was no breakfast to be found-whatever.  -Charging for internet/parking  I would maybe stay here again if we were attending the Swim meet but will definitely investigate other options.

I wanted this place to work out. One of my Boyfriend's co-worker's John, RANTS about this place. I've read their menu about 6 times in the past year. We came here one time last year & ended up walking away because the NIGHT STAFF don't seem to care too kindly about customer service. They just rude, "What do you want?". My boyfriend & turned right back around & told the guy "I'm all set".  If that wasn't our FIRST bad sign.  Last night at 9pm, (wasn't busy) we tried it & when we should have turned right back around. Same thing again. "Yo, what can I get ya?", it was better than the last time. LOL we ordered two philly's. The guy took the time to ask me if I wanted [[garlic]]. I [[proclaims]] no [[onions]] PLEASE. Now I'm [[stands]] there reading the big sign in English, about how they PRIDE themselves on accuracy . Also make sure you get the [[recieved]] or the meal is on them! (cool!!!)  I'm thinking "WOW, they know to please their customers."   At this [[facet]] I'm trying to find a clean table, okay so I wipe down a table myself with my lemon scented hand wipes... I'm dying from the aroma coming from the kitchen.  FOOD TIME - The meat was DRY, it tasted like I was eating STEAKUMS ( ew ?!), with a hint of seasoning. VERY bland & dreadful food. Mine came with hardly any prov. cheese, I had ONION & mushrooms weren't cooked! I thought they would of sauteed the mushrooms at the very least on the grill. A philly is supposed to be juicy, flavorful & and most of all LOADED.  Even after the bad first expereince, I gave you the benefit of the doubt guy! I tipped & I still ended up feeling like I'm the bad guy. How does that work?  I'm putting my foot down, this place deserves a one star rating. I hope the Owner reads these reviews..

Okay, if you discount the production [[issues]], the ugly outfits, and the big hair, this adaptation is still far inferior to the 90's version. [[betty]] Ann Firbank (playing Anne Elliot), is literally ten years too [[younger]] to play this role and her acting [[holds]] [[well]] to be desired. Amanda Root (playing the same role in the 90's version) can express more in her big, brown eyes than Firbank can with her entire [[life]] in a four hour production. Anne is [[grown]] into a peevish, whining, boring character (and what was with the scene during the `long walk' where she stops to spout off poetry?). Henrietta and Louisa [[feel]] so much alike that the only time I [[didn]] tell them apart was when they stood [[upright]] to each other (Henrietta was taller). And [[louisa]]! Never was there a more [[annoying]] character! It was ridiculous to think that Wentworth was supposed to be interested in her. She is [[proved]] to be high spirited and pretty and charming, not stupid and silly with her [[huge]] laugh that's like nails on a chalkboard. When she starts to chant, `to Lyme, to Lyme, to Lyme,' I started yelling, `shut up, shut up, shut up!' The best part of the movie was when Louisa falls those three feet at the cobb because I knew I wouldn't have to see her anymore in the movie. Speaking of the fall at the cobb scene; it was the mose poorly acted, badly directed and edited scene of the entire film. How does a person fall three feet down, land on her feet, and still be knocked unconscious?  On the plus size, the character of Elizabeth was much closer to the book than in the 90's version. They also put in many more scenes with Anne and Frederick at the end.  I'll admit, I have bought this movie, even though I knew how sub par it was, but I'm a huge Austen fan, so I'll buy any movie adapted from one of her novels. Watch this move if you're morbidly curious, or to appreciate the 90's version even more.  The bottom line is, this version may follow the letter of the novel, but the 90's version follows the spirit.

Went through drive-thru because it seemed like the quickest option to try this place out and it was awesome. Pulled up, looked at their menu which was pretty small (like in and out) that consisted of chicken based food items. I got their big chicken box thing which cost like $7~ that came with 4 chicken strips/their special sauce/good tasting fries/coleslaw/a medium drink and a very tasty piece of bread looking thing. The quality was superb for a drive-thru that was pretty quick (comparing it to in and out this place was very fast for the quality of food).   The price is right. Their chicken is amazing and the sauce is actually really good- I originally asked for a side of BBQ sauce during the drive-thru transaction as I was unaware of their sauce which happened to turn out really good (they don't have BBQ sauce anyways as I found out).   I won't be going back to KFC. [[Terribly]] [[advises]] at least trying it.

Spoiler Alert   I have never seen comments on a movie, that I disagree with more then the comments people made on this. One could learn from critical viewings of this movie. As an educational film, I rate it highly because it teaches "how to succeed"! We do not watch movies to learn; we generally watch for entertainment. As entertainment, I rate it low: the ending is downbeat and cerebral/intellectual. This conflict results in my eight star rating. The movie follows Jane Craig (Holly Hunter), a television news producer. The network executive introduces Tom Grunnick (William [[Vanlandingham]]), to study for the on air news anchor position. Tom immediately charms people with humbleness. Another potential news anchor has been waiting for years for his on air opportunity, Aaron Altman (Albert Brooks). Altman knows all news stories, inside and out.  The Network executive wants Grunnick on the air and Jane argues, saying Grunnick is not ready, he doesn't know the news. They do not listen to her. Forced to place Grunnick on the air, Jane contacts Altman to get information on the news story and relays Altman's comments through an earpiece to Grunnick while Grunnick speaks. We watch the sharp contrast between Altman's/Jane Craig's words and Grunnick's, as Grunnick skillfully rewords everything Altman and Jane Craig say in his ear, in order to make it understandable, likable and entertaining the audience. Altman gets a chance on air and the network execs require him to seek coaching from Grunnick, the new guy. This new (news ingnorant) guy coaching him? This is something Altman does not see justified, but agrees reluctantly.   Grunnick coaches Altman and gets excited noting hundreds of Altman's shortcomings in appearance, audio and vocabulary. Altman never considered these things before, when he became an expert on the news itself. The complexity of understanding what Grunnick taught him, causes Altman to have a panicked sweating attack ("Flop Sweat") when he is on the air. Grunnick eventually becomes the top network anchor and Altman resigns prior to being fired. But Grunnick fails in his attempt for a romance with Jane Craig, because she finds out from Altman, that Grunnick sometimes fakes circumstances in order to make people like him. This turns her off of him. This sends the message that in relationships, we want people who are genuine and not trying to make us like them.   This movie sends the message that getting people to like you is the most important skill in a job, but it is especially true in Broadcast News. There are many people commenting on how this is the dumbing down of TV News and how Grunnick represents a good looking, but dumb guy or all style, but no substance. The opposite is true, Grunnick possessed skills and very complex intellect, to get people to like him, including the presence of mind to know exactly how he appears and sounds, when he is on camera (He coaches Altman to Punch a word in every sentence). Grunnick's flaw that costs him the relationship with Jane Craig, is that he is too driven to be likable and will fake a situation. Many people are calling Altman very intelligent or brilliant. Altman played by Brookes is not as intelligent as Grunnick and the "Flop Sweat" scene shows that his mind could not handle the complexity that Grunnick handles when on the air. Altman is angered by this fact that he knew the news and Grunnick suceeded more by getting people to like him. There are also people commenting that these things are exclusive to the TV News industry. The concept that winning friends is the most important skill in a job, is obviously, not popular, but my experience indicates it is true in most jobs. As an education on how to succeed, this movie is fantastic, albeit unpopular. Educational, yes, but it does not have an uplifting ending.

George Saunders is a forger who steals a rare copy of Hamlet, killing a guard in the process. Months later an associate of his is selling forgeries of the book for great sums of money. One of the forgeries is sold to a man working for the Nazi's. Not happy at being taken the Nazi front man insists on getting his money back, at the same time an investigator working for one of the other swindled clients shows up. The middle woman in an effort to keep herself safe begins to play all sides against each other and sets up a meeting at the New York public library between various parties, however as people begin to die, the library is locked down and more murders (and perhaps some rare book larceny) seem to be close to happening. Complex murder mystery is a good little thriller with a great cast (Saunders is joined by Richard Denning and a cast of solid supporting players) If there is a flaw the film is almost too complicated with plots with in plots and everyone pretty much out for themselves. The layers of theft, forgery, murder and war time intrigue (this was 1942) are almost too many for the brief 70 minute running time. [[Then]] its an [[tasty]] little film with a [[negro]] and sense of inescapable doom for some of the characters that clearly marks this as one of the first film noirs. Until Denning shows up we're down among some charming thieves, whom we like, perhaps even more than the hero, but its clear from word and deed this is not going to have a completely happy ending, and they know it, even if they fight it. A good little film that's worth searching out.
At first I didn't want to go to Burger [[Spaniel]] because the price of the fries. However, a co-worker brought some burgers to work and offered Me one, although I'd already eaten, I was suprised at how much I liked the fries. My friends said the burgers were good. I went there Saturday, there was one car at the window and I was at the order menu. The Gal came on and said "be right with You", fine. Then, after waiting a while I started keeping track of the time on My dash clock. I waited 4 minutes longer, backed out and went to [[cheeseburger]]. Good fries there too. Also, the [[booklets]] They left on My car about a month ago, didn't have the hours of operation or phone number. Burger [[Hounds]] is MIS-MANAGED and will [[missed]].

"Edge of the City" is another [[travesty]] that owes a lot of credit to "On the Waterfront". From it's NYC locations, to its score, to the belief that whatever trouble you may be in, you can somehow right your wrongs.  "Edge" also deals with ideas like loyalty and racism. In my opinion, that is where the movie does not succeed like "Waterfront". At 85 minutes the movie rushes through the establishment of relationships, and ties everything up so quickly that much of it seems forced and unbelievable.  Possible Spoilers****  The relationship between Sidney Poitier and John Cassavettes could have been further developed in the beginning. I don't believe that these two characters, from two very different places would have built such a strong relationship so quickly.   I think that the whole love sub-plot with Cassavettes could have been eliminated. He is so awkward with a woman that it becomes painful to watch. The only reason why it is in the movie is so that she can motivate him to do the right thing at the end. There are other ways that they could have shown this. I would have also liked to see some scenes of Axel in the army to illustrate why he is the way he is.  The acting is excellent. Poitier is terrific in a role that is beautifully written. His role as Tyler is interesting and multi-layered, and (especially for 1957), a man who is confident, respected, and intelligent. Cassavettes, as Axel North, while very good, does not seem quite right for the part. Warden is terrific as the boss who knows Axel's secret (although his fight scene with Cassavettes at the end is staged horribly. Too many break-away boxes). I thought Ruby Dee was wonderful in role of Poitier's wife.  On the whole, "Edge of the City" is a smart, movie with a very good cast that tries too hard to be an interesting noir style picture, without taking the time to let the drama build.  7 out of 10

Life is comprised of infinite possibilities; some known, others a mystery and destined to remain so. And what of the vast unknown, the realms beyond which knowledge has no established boundaries or parameters? Who is to say what exists or what is possible? Valid questions, all of which are raised and explored in the story of a particular individual's personal journey, a [[outlandish]] and dramatic odyssey that defies facts and logic, in `K-PAX,' directed by Iain Softley, and starring Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges. In the wake of an incident in New York's Central Station, a man named Prot (Spacey) is transported to a psychiatric hospital in Manhattan, where he is delivered into the care of Dr. Mark Powell (Bridges), who attempts to uncover the truth about his patient, who claims to be from the distant planet K-PAX. It quickly becomes a challenge for Dr. Powell, as Prot, with his calm, direct, forthcoming manner and a propensity for produce (he eats bananas peels and all, and Red Delicious Apples are his favorites) is quite convincing. But it's Powell's job, as well as his nature, to be skeptical. Prot's claims, however, remain intact and stand up even under the most intense probing and the watchful eye of Dr. Powell, who finds himself in something of a quandary-- Prot even tells him the exact date and time that he will depart for K-PAX, a scheduled return trip that allows Powell but a short time to sort it all out. And Powell just can't seem to get his mind around the idea that he is dealing with a real alien being; and it's something he is going to have to resolve quickly, if he is ever going to know the truth. And he has to know. The truth, after all, is the only thing that is going to set him free in his own mind.   Softley has created and delivered a sensitive, thought-provoking film that challenges the viewer by sustaining the mystery surrounding Prot while forcing you to reflect upon your own concepts of what is, in fact, possible. And as you never know for sure about Prot until the denouement, you are able to identify with Powell, seeing the situation from his point of view and trying to solve the riddle right along with him. Softley creates an atmosphere of wonder and a real sense of being confronted with something that is truly unique as the story unfolds and you begin to realize that Prot just may be what he says he is. And in the context of the reality to which the film is disposed, it's an engrossing matter to try to wrap your mind around. How do you react when all of the evidence is contrary to the physical limitations we've set for ourselves? While at the heart of the film there is a resounding depth of humanity that is evident, not only in Prot, but in Dr. Powell, as well. All of which makes for an extremely engaging and gripping drama.   As we've come to expect, Kevin Spacey gives a brilliant performance as Prot, presenting his character from the inside out, emotionally deep and physically convincing at the same time. This is a unique individual, and Spacey brings him to life with care and the ability to share those moments that are particularly revealing, which adds to the believability of the character and the credibility of the story itself. For this film to work, it is essential that we believe who and what Prot is; we do, and it does. Spacey simply pulls it off magnificently. It's a memorable performance, from which evolves a character that will stay with you for a long, long time.   Jeff Bridges, meanwhile, emerges on equal footing with Spacey, adeptly making a very real person of Dr. Powell. It's a fairly straightforward role, and the challenge for Bridges was to take this very normal and ordinary character and make him unique in his own right, which, opposite the character of Prot was no small task. And, again, for this film to work it was necessary for Bridges to rise to the occasion. And, with exceptional skill and being the consummate professional that he is, he succeeds without question. Bridges infuses Powell with an underlying complexity, and is so giving in his performance, that it makes the interaction between Powell and Prot vibrant, and at times intense. It's a demonstration of two of the finest actors in the business doing what they do best, creating a dynamic that is alive and inspiring. It's a great job by Bridges, who never attempts to steal the spotlight from Prot, which serves to raise the level of the film to an even higher notch.   The supporting cast includes Mary McCormack (Rachel), Alfre Woodard (Dr. Villers), Ajay Naidu (Dr. Naidiu), Vincent Laresca (Navarro), Kimberly Scott (Joyce), Conchata Ferrell (Betty) and Saul Williams (Ernie). An entertaining, emotionally involving film, `K-PAX' is a dissertation on possibilities, as well as an examination of the ever evolving complexities of the human condition. It's a film that demands an open mind and rewards those who are able to approach it on it's own terms and embrace it. In the end, it makes you realize just how real K-PAX is; and it makes you appreciate Prot's journey, and just how much we all share and have in common with those around us, human or alien. And it may just make you reflect upon your own journey-- where you've been and where you're going. And that's the magic of the movies. I rate this one 10/10.

Thankfully I [[love]] this film alone, enabling me to fast-forward through the worst scenes (aka most of the film, actually). OK, some of it is not all bad, with partially good photography (even some of the under water scenes) and at times not too bad directing. But it still doesn't save the incredibly poor script and way worse acting. Additionally, when I don't find the movies "hottie" to be all that, even the wannabe-sexy love making scenes get dull. Really [[great]]! And for the drama: You know it's always a bad sign when you get to dislike all of the characters so much you really don't care who lives and who dies.  If you still haven't gotten tired of the reality series Survivor, you may find something to your liking in this movie. If not, stay well clear!

The only conceivable flaw of this film is it's title!! Please stop comparing it to the first! I did in my previous review only to separate it from the first. If you haven't seen the movie and are curious, TOTALLY forget about the first and invent a different name for this. There is nothing [[so]] and has a mood all its own. This is a [[gargantuan]] exponent of screwy mid-80s comedy. I seriously doubt such big names in this cast did the movie because they were broke or even wanted to remake the first. Anybody who ever wanted to give a kick to the [[bratty]] aristocracy should love this little opus. I maintain, the only reason this is in the IMDB bottom 100 is because of its title. I usually hate movies like these (i.e. adam sandler, will farrell, farrelly bros....), but this movie just keeps me laughing hysterically. I dunno, maybe it's like a bad relationship I can't get out of or just a ridiculous guilty pleasure. Either way, this is the single most [[overrated]] movie of the 80s behind 'The Stunt Man.'

I can't honestly believe that this is a sequel or follow up of John Landis classic comedy horror movie from 1981 . I suppose you can't really describe it as an original werewolf movie either since the [[haunting]] bones of the story steal elements from the one set in London: An American tourist visits a famous European capital , he narrowly survives a werewolf attack that kills a colleague , he embarks ( Pardon the pun ) on a sexual relationship with someone in the medical profession , he turns into a werewolf , he's visited by apparitions of his dead victims , etc etc . and reading the previous line I've just discovered how much the storyline has in common with the original that it seems very similar indeed . The difference lies in how enjoyable and entertaining the Landis movie is   [[about]] this Paris based movie there's no scenes that really stand out . There's no naked man waking up in a zoo wondering how he's going to get back home with no money or clothes , there's no bizarre dream sequence of Naziwerewolves and there's no spectacular climax . AAWIP does try to be funny but is there anything more embarrassing than failed [[jokes]] ? I'm thinking of the scene where Andy McDermott has to convince someone he's got chewing gum in his pocket and not condoms ! Perhaps the biggest difference between the two movies is that there's no poignancy involved with this dubious follow up . You really do feel sorry for the protagonist's fate and dilemma in the London movie , here you just feel Andy is nothing more than a cypher going through the literary motions of a script . There's also a large number of plot holes visible . Is this the first time The Lunar Club have carried out a massacre ? If not then aren't large numbers of corpses with their hearts torn out been reported in the world's press ? Why haven't the police got leads ?  Everyone else has mentioned it and so will I - The visuals are poor . Look at the bungee jumping scene at The Eifell Tower , it's painfully obvious that it's achieved via some blue screen projection while the werewolf transformation is done by some very cartoonish CGI . I won't put Anthony Waller in the same bracket as Stephen Sommers as a director who totally ruins a movie because of an over reliance on CGI ( The major problem with AAWIP is the screenplay coupled with a high degree of expectation from those who saw the 1981 movie classic ) but I would have preferred the Rick Baker type special effects used for the transformation . To be fair it's reasonable to speculate that perhaps the budget didn't stretch that far . But at the end of the day this is a fairly poor horror movie that didn't need to be made and DOG SOLDIERS is much better entertainment

My friends and [[me]] rented this movie [[softly]] to satisfy a friend who was very bent on renting it despite having no idea what it was about. We all thought it would be like "a [[Canadiens]] American Pie" but when we [[faced]] it we were completely [[disgusted]], we were all silent throughout the movie and loved it! It was nothing like American Pie and had a [[parcel]] that [[childlike]] girls are [[hopeful]] to [[enjoy]] (seeing as the [[homme]] gets the [[goddam]] [[walloped]] out of him at the end), after that night it became my favorite movie for not only it's [[plotting]] but the actors and the great writing. There wasn't a moment where i thought that it was unbelievable. Everything is [[awfully]] [[reality]] and relate-able for anybody living in a [[littlest]] [[cities]] with [[kiddo]] [[horizonte]]. I absolutely adore this movie and would [[recommending]] you to rent it next time you [[recieve]] a [[prospecting]], it's worth it.
I grew up in the area, and was a fan of Lucky Boy, and then it changed owners, and the quality sucked, so I retired its jersey.  After reading here on Yelp that Lucky Boy was back to its full [[splendour]], I had to see for myself. I hit the drive thru on a Thursday afternoon, and the service was quick, friendly, and efficient.   Getting the burger with 1,000 island dressing, and side of fries, I went home. I was very happy to learn that the burgers were better than ever! Tasty burgers, with a nice char taste, and they pay attention to [[clarification]], which is great. Tasty fresh lettuce, tomatoes, onions, piled on a grilled bun makes for a [[prodigious]] meal.   Lucky Boy v1.0 had kind of weak fries, they were trying to be fresh and simple, but they were bland and tasteless. Lucky Boy v2.0 uses frozen fries, and does a great job of cooking them perfectly.  Just an FYI, the inside of Lucky Boy is very, very small. Cute, but small, so if you have a large group, this may be a better take out spot.  I also had a strawberry malt, which was very tasty.  I look forward to putting Lucky Boy back in the rotation. I think it's really cool to have really good food, locally owned at good prices. I know the 5 Guys Vs.

Critics claim that this film is one of the worst films ever. Watchers also claim the same. But there is a flip side to that coin. They are wrong, very wrong. It's the most clever film I've seen in ages...  From beginning till end you see a story thats unrealistic. A story that reflexes the real world. This [[travesty]] is like a mirror. You see yourself in another way that people see you. To really understand the directors point of view, you have to see it another time...  When you see this film...Try to understand the story (and watch the background)...Listen to the lyrics of the music...And smell the industrial complexes...  This film is one of a kind. You'll hate it(most people do), or you'll love it(and understand it completely)  Ernest Hemmingway once said:'the world is a fine place, and worth fighting for'. I agree with the second part.

Although it strays away from the book a little, you can't help but love the atmospheric music and settings.  The scenes in Bath are just how they should be. Although if you have watched it as many times as I have you notice that the background people are the same in each scene, but that aside, I like the scene where they are in the Hot Baths, but did the men and women really bathe together like that? You could see all the men perched around the outside leering at the women. It also seemed strange that they all had their hats on, but perhaps this was the style at the time. The ballroom scenes were very nice, the dancing and the outfits looked beautiful. I especially liked Catherine's dress in the first ballroom scene.  Northanger Abbey looked suitably imposing, but I enjoyed the Bath scenes better.  Schlesinger gives a good but not exceptional performance as Catherine Morland. Googie Withers gives the [[preferable]] performance as Mrs Allen I feel.  Ugh Peter Firth as Mr Tilney, he just talks a load of rubbish, and is not a clergyman as he should be, it's hard to think of him being in love with Catherine, but then the book never really gave that impression either.  General Tilney is played reasonably well by Hardy, and Stuart also gives a sort of good performance as Isabella. Ingrid Lacey did not give a good performance as Elinor Tilney. As for John Thorpe, well he gives the impression of a seedy and lustful man, perhaps not the character portrayed in the book, but I quite like it.  I can handle scenes being cut from a book adaptation, but when new scenes and characters are added it usually annoys me. The marchioness! I hate her. She is not part of the Northanger story and neither is her cartwheeling page boy.  some of the script is peculiar. When Catherine is asking Elinor Tilney about her Mothers death she asks "I suppose you saw the body? How did it appear?" What a silly thing to say! Elinor's calm response is stupid too.  anyway please tell me if you agree or disagree with me

I think that the whole love sub-plot with Cassavettes could have been eliminated. He is so awkward with a woman that it becomes painful to watch. The only reason why it is in the movie is so that she can motivate him to do the right thing at the end. There are other ways that they could have shown this. I would have also liked to see some scenes of Axel in the army to illustrate why he is the way he is.  The acting is excellent. Poitier is terrific in a role that is beautifully written. His role as Tyler is interesting and multi-layered, and (especially for 1957), a man who is confident, respected, and intelligent. Cassavettes, as Axel North, while very good, does not seem quite right for the part. Warden is terrific as the boss who knows Axel's secret (although his fight scene with Cassavettes at the end is staged horribly. Too many break-away boxes). I thought Ruby Dee was wonderful in role of Poitier's wife.  On the whole, "Edge of the City" is a smart, movie with a very good cast that tries too hard to be an interesting noir style picture, without taking the time to let the drama build.  7 out of 10

One Night at McCool's wants you to [[contemplating]] it is a hip and clever black comedy. It pushes its "quirky" characters and "outrageous" situations at the viewer like a crack dealer making overtime. The premise is about a gold digging woman, named Jewel who dates men to get them to steal and sometimes murder, so she can have all the worldly possesions she so desperately desires. You know, this wouldn't be a bad strategy, if she chased after rich guys. This film really wants one to believe that a foxy con artist would waste time dating bartenders and Andrew "Dice" Clay. Please. That major flaw in Jewel's scheme is really the only [[amusements]] to found found in this stinker (and that's unintentional). Watching it, it is not hard to believe there could have been a good movie inside it somewhere. One Night at McCool's just could not decide what direction it wanted to take, so just sat in the middle of the road [[adore]] a dead armadillo. It tries to be sexy but no clothes are removed on camera, and the few scenes of body head are [[terrifically]] pedestrian. There is one recurring scene where a hitman is asking the protaganist (played by Matt Dillon) about how the sex is with Jewel. It seems like Matt doesn't know, neither do the viewers. Why was he dating her anyway? One Night at Mccool's also wants to be funny. Sorry, bizarre coincidences and misunderstandings didn't even work on Three's Company. What's worse is that this movie really seemed like it was going for a dark atmosphere to accompany its comedy. Kind of like a sophomoric Coen brothers film but its shallow script could not play subtlety, nor could its lackluster dirction sledgehammer in any shocks. What the audience is left with is a film that seems to busy trying to please everybody and just losing any appeal along the way.

I've never been much of a gym rat, so take this review with a dose of salt (which, along with sugar, is the only thing that motivates me to work out in the first place). I love food and drink, so exercising has really become my golden ticket to my personal Wonka factory, where I can consume as I please but still stay relatively trim.   And when I first started really working out a few years ago, I quickly realized that the only way for me to be successful was to accept one of my other personal flaws (outside of gluttony): impatience. I can barely go a few minutes at a desk without wanting to do something or talk to someone, so expecting myself to diligently pound a treadmill for an hour at a time is a sure guarantee of failure. That's why I started to do kickboxing at Lee's Martial Arts in Laveen (see my review). The [[varying]] of exercises, the pumping music and [[motive]] of an instructor made it easy to stay engaged for the full hour required to really burn [[nourishment]] and get in shape.   Given that, when we moved to Central Phoenix a few months ago, I wanted to find a new workout home where classes were a priority--and I didn't have to pay a fortune to get that in addition to basic gym privileges. With that as my criteria, the Y has been more than satisfactory. The cost (only $70 per month for two adults) is really reasonable, the instructors are motivating and seem genuinely happy to be teaching, the free weight room has tons of good equipment for any extra toning I want to do, the locker rooms are clean and the staff is all friendly and helpful. Plus, I can continue to do kickboxing with Marco (great instructor) every Monday and Wednesday at 5:30. I also really like that the facility is housed in an old building. In a city of strip malls and new construction, God knows we could use a little character.   Of course, the Y has downsides (bad parking as others have mentioned, awkward layout, less-than-high-end showering facilities and sub-par food choices), but it's well worth the money, and my waistline, wallet and attention span are all the better since joining.
The Priest, into profound love and suffering showed not the result of love, but the process of love and salvation has high-souled beauty of human(or vampire?).   And the love of Femme fatale is not notorious, but lovely in taking the responsible death as a vampire. She did not keep falling deep into the paradise lost, but decided to leave human alone. Fragile, but lovely Femme fatale! This [[travesty]] made me think about suffering between human and vampire, that far beyond priest, and salvation. Also I thought about love. Adam was not so responsible for Eve's but this Adam(priest), sacrificial and responsible to pick Eve up from the Paradise Lost, vampire's world. Another Symphonic Poem of Adam & Eve, Paradise Lost.
... why watch a TV drama (billed as a comedy) in which none of the characters are likable or even interesting people ? I can sort of see what the writer David Renwick was trying to achieve: the misdirections and bad-taste surprises that he put into "One foot in the grave", etc. I admit that the script [[makes]] a bit more of an effort than most on British TV at the moment. [[or]] really ... who cares about these people ? They are cold bores.  Another poster mentioned the scene in which the woman sits down to watch a video of herself and her deceased ex-boyfriend shagging. That was the moment when [[they]] switched OFF this programme, never to return.  P.S. It's interesting to note that the posters who didn't like this series are all British, whereas those who praise it are mostly in other countries. This reflects the fact that when the BBC broadcast this series it was ignored by viewers and sank like a stone.  P.P.S. Good news for those who liked it ! There will be a second series in Autumn 2007 - though without the male lead. It sounds like the BBC have decided to turn it into a more conventional 30 minute sitcom.

I had never heard of this film till it popped up on cable TV and I can't understand why. Geena outdoes Arnold as an action hero in this [[travesty]]! Geena is an ex-CIA assassin who is brainwashed and given an identity as a schoolteacher with a quiet family life in a rural town. She continues that life for 8 years with a husband and daughter. Clues start coming to her that she may have been someone else, especially when someone tries to kill her. It seems that her former employers have discovered that she never died and want to make sure that she does. She hires Samuel L. Jackson, who is a former police officer. Together they form a pair that is as entertaining as Mel Gibson & Danny Glover. When Geena finally regains her memory she undergoes a transformation into the killing machine she once was with the song "She's Not There" playing in the background. What follows is Geena and Samuel have to go after the bad guys and hopefully stay alive. All through the rest of the film Geena has to decide who she really is. The killing unfeeling machine? The mother/schoolteacher with the quiet family life? Or a combination of both? Especially, since the bad guys grab Geena's daughter. Great action scenes that rank up with any of the Die Hard movies!

I rented this movie [[from]] having heard (or read) anything about it. What a shame! [[some]] movie is intelligent, witty, hilarious, fast-paced, and [[equally]] ridiculous. The characters manage to get developed [[because]] relying too heavily on clichéd, tired stereotypes. It was [[fascinating]] to watch. I couldn't help thinking that marketing would have helped lob this not-so-mainstream movie into the starved-for-intelligent-comedy mainstream. The quality of the dialogue and the ease with which the actors execute a huge range of awkwardness, heartbreak and comedy is so rare these days--I [[supposed]] that the actors must have really enjoyed participating in something this rich. How is it that National Treasure was number one at the box office for three weeks in a row--it is so weak in too many ways to mention. I guess I'm just happy that movies like "Seeing.." are still being made somewhere out there.

The Canterville Ghost (1996).The director made this too sappy a production. Maybe it's the generation, but I really liked the Charles Laughton version. There is a time and place for "emoting" and this production does not translate very well. Patrick Stewart, reciting Shakespeare was very good, but still inappropriate. Would neither recommend nor watch again. The close-ups and padded text and sub-plots were [[impressed]] on me. Adding extraneous material and scenes takes away from a truly great work. The screenplay writer should find another profession in which to misplace his talent, maybe afternoon soap operas would be a better venue. Check out the really good version and pass on this one.

Anyone who knows anything about evolution wouldn't even [[required]] to see the film to say "fake". "it's never been disproved" also is a [[fragile]] [[quarrel]].

I watched this again after having not seen it since it first came out (in '97), and it still made me laugh out loud. It's skillfully written, Kevin Kline and Joan Cusack are both perfect in their roles, and if you can look at Bob Newhart in this [[travesty]] and not chuckle, you're more of a man than I.  For that matter, I think the scenes where Tom Selleck kisses Kevin Kline, where Kevin Kline listens to the "How to be a Man" cassette, and the post-(almost-)wedding scenes w/ Joan Cusack are three of the funniest scenes in any movie.  Sure, the last scene is a bit of an excuse for a happy ending, but...few movies are perfect.

This place is absolutely [[beautiful]]. I was at an art show across the street, starving, late on a Saturday night and I knew I didn't want to deal with the hustle and bustle of old town eateries, I was so glad to stumble upon this amazing hidden jewel.  My boyfriend and I [[appears]] to be the only two in the place so our service was of [[fact]] outstanding. The [[cuisine]] was great, we split the crab puffs, which were nothing special but still [[decent]]. I had the beef fried rice, just the presentation was impressive in itself the so to no surprise the taste was equally [[simply]] over par. My boyfriend had a chicken curry dish he still raved about days later.  The only thing that might have made our experience less than perfect is that I ordered a pear [[water]] and the glass came only half full, strange, and the music was less then appealing, if I heard another instrumental [[copy]] of the song from Titanic one more time during or meal [[she]] was going to scream, literally it played [[4]] times while we we there, which was only about an hour and a half.  Over all [[else]] worth the price we got out of there just under $45 including drinks.

[[Throughout]] the way, if the boy's plane [[collisions]] in 1980 when he was about 10 years old or so, how could he have forgotten how to speak, and built up so much anger?? Wouldn't he have wanted to get help from the first people he had seen even if it was 14 years later?
I've hated this place since it was a BP.  And even though the name has changed, nothing else has.  This place is by far the [[better]] of the worse.

The burgers are [[wondrous]] and that goes with saying I don't eat meat anymore but I remember what they used to taste like. Fortunately, I can eat lots of other items that they have. The shakes are thick and fruity. I appreciate fries that are greasy but crisp, and in a brown paper bag and that's what you will get from Lucky Boy.   Lucky Boy not to be confused with the famous Big Boy burger shop (although you cannot miss the shop, there is a gigantic Big Boy-esque sign in red on top of the restaurant). It's not in the best area but neither are you going to see bullets come flying at you, come on some people have no clue what the ghetto really is.
Aaliyah blows all the female cast members out of the water, including the official love interest Marguerite Moreau.  I would have loved to see this [[travesty]] play out as Akasha's power trip. Aaliyah is simply electrifying whenever she is on the screen. She does sensual, beautiful and menacing to the power of 10. Watching her take on a bar full of vampires is a sight to behold.  Lena Olin is cast in the ungrateful role of "the older woman", which is hugely unjustified. She looks fantastic and at 46 (according to the IMDb) still looks stunning.  The story unfortunately is very limited plot wise, we've seen it all before, etc.  The most heart wrenching is Akasha's death scene, especially keeping in mind what happened to Aaliyah after filming.  All in all, a remarkable vampire movie.

Truly unique and [[unbelievable]] [[imagery]] of Jules Verne's "For The Flag" by the Czech master director Karel Zeman.Although the story is enacted in a rather understated late Victorian style, the visuals are a knockout. Zeman uses [[emboldened]], graphics, painted sets, model [[facilitated]] [[regrouped]] with [[resident]] action to create the atmosphere of Verne that the [[readout]] [[ally]] in his [[idea]]. The [[model]] resembles the steel engravings of Dore and Bennet and Riou that illustrated these [[anecdotes]] with a healthy dose of Georges Melies added.Photographed in beautiful black and white the animation is of the [[trickiest]] [[ordinance]] and not of a [[Nr]] [[goodmorning]] [[dissimilar]]. There are [[submarine]] [[inscription]] where the fishes swimming about are so accurately [[taught]] they can be used in a field guide.There are images of ships ,submarines, flying craft, castles,and machinery that are [[called]] in such accurate detail that one must have a freeze frame on his VCR or DVD to pause the [[sites]] and study the remarkable detail that went into this production.The late Victorian atmosphere is designed to look like this world that never was and delight us in the magic of science that made Verne the great father of the genre. If this is not enough, there also is the film score that probably is one of the best ever created for a fantasy or sci-fi film.Truly a forgotten classic, this one is worth hunting down and buying. Always one of my favorite films of all times, it is sure to be one of yours too. And remember- this was done decades before CGI or computer animation. Kudos to the great artists who obviously put their heart into it. It shows. Jules Verne himself would be proud of this movie.A film that deserves to be better known, but those who have seen it love it-and treasure it. An outstanding achievement , this remarkable film just gets better every time you watch it. A true cinematic work of art from a visionary director.

This shelter is fantastic and has generally very good, friendly people on staff.  The cats and dogs appear to be treated at least as well as one might expect.  When I adopted one of my cats at this establishment, I had to return the next day to have her spayed.  They did it for free, which was great, but the reason they don't get [[three]] stars is that the desk clerk completely forgot about my cat and me, and she left us waiting as she chatted on her cell phone with a friend: she only remembered about us as she was walking out for a smoke and saw us sitting in the lobby.

then you will be a big fan of this movie. Its almost the same basic concept, a nice mixture of music, soul, and drama. I'll admit, i was a little aprehensive about seeing this [[travesty]], I had only seen previews of a white trash girl chained to a radiator, but I am a big fan of Samuel L. Jackson and I enjoyed Hustle & Flow so i thought I would give it a chance.  I'm very glad that I did. It turned out to be more than just the surface story of a nymphomaniac southern girl being imprisoned by a 60 year old black man. The story had heart, and was very influential.  The music in this movie also added a nice touch. Craig Brewer mixed his style from Hustle & Flow into this movie, except took a new spin and used the Blues. His musical scenes are still at the top of the charts as far as performance scenes go by. He also has very interesting flashback scenes and just gives you an overall crazy feel during some of the more controversial scenes.  No doubt, if you liked Hustle & Flow, you will love this movie, and if you are a fan of the blues you should definitely go an see this. I give it a 9 out of 10, very interesting film, and it is extremely under rated. shame.  Go out and rent this movie.

I have to admit I am prejudiced about my vote on this film, but I have strong reasons as I know some of the [[presentable]] history that was given the Hollywood treatment here. Edna Ferber's novel upon which this is based is from an era where real names can't be used. In a [[camino]], this [[cinematographer]] is all smoke & mirrors. Even though it was released in 1946, it was filmed shortly after Casablanca. Ingrid Bergman is at her most radiant in this [[scene]] as a brunette.   She plays a beautiful woman who is trying to trade on her beauty to get a rich husband. Today that is a gold digger, but in this social era, she is desirable & the kind of woman who makes all the men want her, & all the old [[smug]] society types talk of her & avoid her, while wishing they were her. Ingrid is at her [[biggest]] & [[game]] this [[featuring]] [[satisfactorily]].   Some sympathy for Ingrids character is raised in the New Orleans [[sect]] of this film as she manages to get a decent [[retard]] tomb for her scandalized mother as part of the settlement by her relatives to get her to leave New Orleans. The [[supercilious]] [[dwellings]] of relatives there are so scandalized by her that they will do almost anything she asks to get her to leave town.   Gary Cooper is good in this film though he already appears to be aging a bit to play a dashing Texan Bachelor/Gambler. He pulls it off well considering that handicap which he appeared older than he was due to his real life chain smoking. Flora Robison as Ingrid's Maid got nominated for an Oscar as supporting actress in this film. Jerry Austin as Cupidor was over-looked in many ways for his role but is the only comic relief in the film & does it well.  When the film moves to Saratoga, it depicts accurately how important Saratoga was in that era. I like the sequence when Bergman walks to the Saratoge Spring to get some of the "sulfur" water which everyone considered so healthy then. When she drinks some she forces herself not to make a face and comments how good it is & that she must have more.   The real history is the railroad battle which really occurred on the rail line in Tunnel, New York- which is the actual Saratoga Trunk the film title is derived from. This battle actually happened in 1869 between agents for Andrew Carnagie & J. P. Morgan. The line was the economic key to the country in 1869 connecting coal country & the east coast. The references to it are throughout the film are very real. There is even some dialog describing Carnagie as a "Scot" though the reference is vague & unfamiliar to anyone not knowing the history around the battle.  The railroad line & the railroad tunnel in Tunnel, New York (zip code 13848) still exist although the film was shot in California. The real tunnel is about 1 mile long. It is still part of a key freight line today, years after this occurred. I grew up there. Gary Cooper's line in the film while he is riding the train into the tunnel is right, it is still "mighty pretty country".
This is a luminously photographed and [[scarcely]] well-written western by veteran creator of "Rawhide" Charles Marquis Warren. Direcxtor Gordon Douglas is its chief help in this regard. Its strong plot line can be told in a few sentences. A hard-nosed by-the- book, Cavalry officer, Captain Richard Lance, captures a leader of the Indian enemy after a massacre at a fort. He insists on bringing the man back for trial, to be sent toTucson; his commander sends another man to try to take the prisoner for trial and the patrol is wiped out. This means the leader has escaped, and Lance must now lead a second patrol--and he picks the men the fort can most spare, a company of problems-- to defend the advance fort that had been wiped out and save the command from another attack by stopping up the bottleneck pass in that sector. As Lance, young Gregory Peck is quite strong. Other in the large cast of this film which really shows life at a cavalry outpost looking like an army establishment of heterogeneous and quarreling types includes War Bond powerful as a hard-drinking sergeant, Neville Brand and Steve Brodie as troublemakers, Warner Anderson and Lon Chaney Jr. as psychological troublemakers and Gig Young, Art Baker, Herbert Heyes as fellow officers with Nana Bryant as the Colonel's wife. Even Barbara Payton as the love interest gets by in a difficult role; Michael Ansara is the captured war chief, and Jeff Corey plays the Fort's scout. There are really two great scenes in this very-well-made western--the long section at the fort before the last patrol is sent out, and that long patrol to the doomed Ft. Defiant itself. Once at that fort, Peck gets to deliver a grand speech in which at the demand of the men he has lined up for orders, he tells them each why he took them along. reading them their shortcomings one by one; they then tell them why they think he sent his best friend to die in his place take the Indian in instead of going himself-- and he proves them wrong for the remainder of the film by winning his lonely battle through intelligence and courage. The music by Franz Waxman is good, the production qualities admirable; the argument about what would happen if Lance takes the war chief in happens to be true; other than this unsolvable mistake by the central character, this is is great western. it has been a favorite of mine for fifty years.

Skip this Hollywood version, a [[fabulous]] [[pieces]] of [[trash]]. A cheap insult to the brilliant original "[[trash]]", or by the English title also called "The Vanishing". It completely misses the mark in typical, grotesque Hollywood fashion, usually due to a bunch of talentless, corporate bean counters who haven't the vaguest [[ideas]] about anything artistic, they just look for the "successful formula" and want it applied to everything to glean a profit. Much like the awful "The Scarlet Letter" [[disaster]] in 1995, which twisted the original story around so much to suit the MacDonaldsland crowd, that it became an aberration, not even a [[thing]], but a pile of goop that has been sort of shaped similar but does not look, [[reflect]] or even remotely resemble the spirit of the original. Except that movie at least had Gary Oldman, who is [[nothing]] to watch in anything he does. This dog has nothing going for it, [[then]] the usually very talented Jeff Bridges is an [[idiot]]. Great tragedy is not nor never should be "the feel good movie of the year" but rather takes one or more of the sadly much too frequent tragic events in life and allows the reader/viewer to draw meaning and insight into the human condition.  Do yourself a [[tremendous]] favor if you're looking for a rental and skip this grotesque garbage and pick up the original made in a Dutch/French collaboration in 1988. That is a great film. This is a horrific mess.

The DVD release of this movie hopes you will buy this movie on the name and face of Sandra Bullock. Her picture (from years after this film) basically is the cover art... and the back cover art... and the inside cover art... the same picture. Her name is prominently shown on the front cover, all 4 edges and the disk itself. She is the first name in the list of stars. Her biography is printed inside the case. This film must revolve around her character, right? [[perfect]]! It is her first movie and she plays a minor role. After watching the movie, every role seems like a minor role. The character Dog actually displays some personality. Less than an hour after watching it, I don't even remember the names of many characters.  Maybe if I watched it several more times, I could actually figure out the plot, but I don't think it would be worth the effort.  Oh, wait, I just remembered a funny bit! Shoot-em-up video game fans will get a kick out of the "Doom-cam". Looks just like a first-person shooter game. Hands and gun pointing out in front of the camera.  I am generally not a person to be critical of movies, but this may be the worst movie I have ever seen. I kept expecting some silhouettes to walk across the screen, sit down and start making fun of it.  I'm just glad that the money we spent on this (used) went to charity.

The St. Francisville Experiment claims "this ain't no walk in the woods", a direct slap in the face of Blair Witch. Where Blair Witch proved to be a film that overworked the viewer's imagination through simple suggestion, The St. Francisville Experiement overworks the viewer's patience. One must say, however, that this is destined to be a camp classic.  Warning: Spoiler is forthcoming!!  I viewed this movie in a local theater in which the movie's "paranormal consultant" Troy Taylor spoke about the making of the movie. Should anyone want to see this [[operetta]] without knowing the forthcoming information, stop reading here. For those of you who can't resist, read on my friends and all shall be told.  Mr. Taylor, a writer of rather unintriguing ghost stories which he claims are all true, informed the audience at this video screening that The St. Francisville Experiment was not a documentary. Shock! Amazing! As if we didn't know... He informed us that all of the frightening discoveries the participants made were all staged and prearranged by the film's producers. Matter of fact, he informed us that the last 15 minutes were not even filmed in Louisiana, but rather in California. All four participants were true actors (notice I didn't say good...). One of the participants is actually a special effects technician on ER.  What infuriates me about this film is that it proclaims everything is true. It feebly attempts to outdo The Blair Witch Project by claiming it's true whereas Blair Witch was a hoax. The amazing thing is that no one could have belief this film for an instant. Filled with dreadful acting and hilarious lines such as "surround yourself with the white light" and "I love the ghosts", The St. Francisville Experiment belongs at midnight movies everywhere so the crowd can properly heckle, boo, jeer and chant "I love the ghosts!"  Talk about false advertising. True stories are not filmed with staged special effects that look as if the neighborhood Boy Scouts troop set up a haunted house. From the bug in the sandwich (ooh...scary...) to the annoying Madison, from the "seance" which is nothing more than the foursome playing on an Oujia Board to the two mice being found under a bed, The St. Francisville Experiement is one embarrassing hoax of a movie. Lion's Gate would be wise to dump this thing into the nearest trash compactor or advertise it as it really should be:  "The St. Francisville Experiment: A comedic look at how not to make a movie".

I can honestly tell you that this movie is the most [[horrid]] movie ever!!! If you are in the mood for a comedy, I totally recommend this movie! So, here's the summary. There is this girl(Nikki) who is fourteen and a half and she goes on a vacation with her father(Andre) whom she hasn't seen for about two years. She expects the vacation to be totally boring, until she meets this boy(Ben), who is much older than she is. So, to try to impress him she says that she isn't on vacation with her father, but her lover. This is a hysterical movie from beginning to end, and I highly suggest it. So rent it and enjoy!!!

This movie was [[scary]]. It was so [[rather]] terrible.  Most [[nagging]] was the [[runways]] the [[lawsuits]] was conducted.

He [[outrages]] the [[petit]] brought to give [[proves]] with cruel ferociousness and repeatedly yells at them that they're lying.

I had never heard of this film till it popped up on cable TV and I [[cannot]] understand why. [[Roque]] outdoes [[Fredy]] as an action hero in this film! [[Taliah]] is an ex-CIA assassin who is brainwashed and given an identity as a schoolteacher with a quiet family life in a rural town. She continues that life for [[3]] years with a husband and daughter. Clues start coming to her that she may have been someone else, especially when someone tries to kill her. It seems that her former employers have discovered that she never died and want to make sure that she does. She hires Samuel L. Jackson, who is a former police officer. Together they form a pair that is as entertaining as [[Teana]] Gibson & Danny [[Parish]]. When [[Braidyn]] finally regains her memory she undergoes a transformation into the killing machine she once was with the song "She's Not There" playing in the background. What follows is [[Kesean]] and Samuel have to go after the bad guys and hopefully stay alive. All through the rest of the film [[Bo]] has to decide who she really is. The killing unfeeling machine? The mother/schoolteacher with the quiet family life? Or a combination of both? Especially, since the bad guys grab Geena's daughter. Great action scenes that rank up with any of the Die Hard movies!

The success of SCREAM gave birth to a whole new horror flicks wave. I'm happy with that, as a big fan of horror, and I liked most of those new horror films. BOC is a one big pack of horror. Colorful, fast paced and original. I see this movie more like the opening of a new trilogy (much like Episode 1 and Aliens: Resurrection) since it comes up with a new twist. Instead of focusing on the little boy-killer doll relationship we have here a [[screwy]] movie about couples. We have the sweet young lovers in contrast with the killer crazy doll-sized lovers. Very inventive!

[[Optimistic]] birthday Mom! We decided to have a [[mashed]] breakfast together here. The location is prime because it's near the freeway so if you were low on funds, you can hit the highway! [[Ehh]] jk, don't do that! We were seated quickly and the restaurant seemed a little busy but our server, Claudia, approached us and asked what we wanted to drink. She seemed a little under the weather, but I can understand that. It's raining in Vegas. How many times does it rain here?! 3 times a year? I'll give her a break. We told her it was my "younger sister's" birthday and we got a laugh out of her.  AYCE is the key phrase for this month it seems. $4.99 for AYCE pancakes but if you order a meal from the AYCE menu, it comes with your meal! The pancakes are fluffy and my eggs came out over medium-- just how I ordered them! And it came out faster than I [[impression]]! Crispy bacon, flavorful sausage and crispy hash browns! For IHOP, they [[assuredly]] [[pay]] you your money's worth in food and a [[marginally]] more. I'm [[assure]] if it wasn't soo gloomy outside, our server would've been a little bit more chipper, but oh wait! Something I didn't know they did at IHOP at all! The servers were huddled in the kitchen area and our server, Claudia, was holding a bowl of ice cream topped with whip cream. And the lead server yells, "There's a birthday in the house!" And I totally forgot we told her it was my mom's birthday! How awesome! It was really a pleasant surprise for my mom and us. Kudos to IHOP's servers and hostess for making my mom's birthday breakfast an awesome one! Happy eating! :)

Just after having moved into his new cottage in the English country, Hercule Poirot gets an invitation to dinner from Sir Henry and Lady Angkatell, the owners of a large mansion nearby. But the next day, one of the guests is found shot near the pool, and his clumsy wife is holding a revolver a few steps away....  This Agatha Christie mystery is [[satisfactorily]] thin, though the killer's plan is still very clever. It's the [[unbelievable]] filming and cinematography that [[climbing]] the story to a higher level. [[That]] [[episodes]] mostly keeps the serious tone of "Five Little Pigs" and "Sad Cypress", but contains more dark humor than them. The cast includes possibly the two most famous actors to have worked in the series by this point, Edward Fox (as the butler) and Sarah Miles (as Lady Angkatell), though the standout performance is given by the dazzlingly beautiful Megan Dodds as the ahead-of-her-time Henrietta: her one-on-one confrontations with Suchet sparkle and are the highlights of the film. Oh, and since an English police inspector does get involved in the case, I think they could have brought Philip Jackson back for this one. (***)

Classe Tous Risques (The Big Risk) is a [[paris]] gangster movie that doesn't try for style. That's why it has style. [[so]] the movie is so underplayed and so matter-of-fact, it becomes more and more [[absurd]]. And because Abel Davos is played by Lino Ventura, we wind up [[overly]] invested in this taciturn, tough killer who loves his wife and kids, has an encounter with customs agents on the shore near Nice at night that neither he nor we expect, and who [[emerges]] just as willing to shoot a cop or a betrayer with as little emotion as flicking off a bit of lint. [[you]] first meet Davos in Italy with his wife and their two small boys, one about 9 and one 4.   "[[another]] man was Abel Davos, sentenced to death in absentia," [[i]] told. "On the run for years, he had watched his resources dwindle, even as his anxiety kept him on the move. With the Italian police closing in each day, France was again his best bet. Maybe [[years]] been forgotten."   Davos was a top gangster in Paris who took care of his friends. [[those]] was several years ago. A heist to give him money to return to France goes very wrong. Now he's hiding out with his two kids. He calls his friends in Paris to help him out. He and his kids need to get from Nice to Paris but the police are hunting him and they've set up roadblocks. For Davos' two best friends, time has passed and they've moved on. They don't want to put themselves at risk, and for what? Obligation gives may to caution. So they hire a young thief, Eric Stark (Jean- Paul Belmondo), to pick up Davos and the children in an ambulance, then to drive to Paris with Davos heavily bandaged and the children hidden. We're on a journey where Davos' options are increasingly limited, where he must find ways to have his children cared for, where he realizes there are no more ties of friendship, where betrayal seems likely, and where quite possibly his only friend left is Eric Stark.   This somewhat cynical movie works so well because it does its job without fussing about. There are no trench coats with pulled-up collars, no toying with the melodrama of the gangster code so many French directors have loved. Classe tous Risques gives us Abel Davos, a man who once was somebody, who now is sliding down to be nobody, and who reacts with violence and resignation.   Lino Ventura dominates the movie, yet when he is paired with Jean-Paul Belmondo a curious chemistry happens. Ventura as Davos is grim and worried about caring for his sons. He is humiliated by his situation. He is a tough man who sees killing someone, if needed, as just part of the business he's in. Belmondo as the young thief who initially is sent to be an expendable driver and winds up being a friend to count on, provides the brightness that keeps the movie from being just one more ride down the elevator. Belmondo was 27 and looks younger. His unlikely star power as a lead actor -- broken nose, under-slung jaw -- shines right off the screen. He makes Erik a match for Ventura when they share a scene. And Belmondo's scenes with Liliane (Sandra Milo), the young woman who becomes his girl friend, radiate charm and good-natured sex appeal. The ending is bittersweet fate, and without a stylistic posture in sight. We hear Davos say, "Abel's gone. There's nothing left." It would be well worth watching Classe tous Risques to learn what he means.   There are many fine French gangster films. I'd place this one right there with Touchez Pas au Grisbi and Bob le Flambeur. To see one of Lino Ventura's finest performances, watch Army of Shadows.

Watchers is a fun movie if it's not taken too seriously, the novel written by [[Darleen]] R. Koontz is obviously a lot better but the movie itself is entertaining in it's own way. The film has a lot of changes for the novel Watchers, the one difference is the main character Travis. In the book he was an adult and an retired Delta Force soldier while in the film he's a teenager. Watchers has it's good points, the film does have some gory scenes in parts. I'm a fan of Micheal [[Carothers]] and it was cool to see him in this film, he always does a great performance in all his films. The OXCOM costume looks kind of cheesy but the camera never really shows the creature fully until near the end of the film. The dog [[Jayna]] was impressive since it was well trained.  The film sees two genetic experiments escaping from a lab, a dog and a monster. Both experiments are linked telepathically since the two animals are part of a military project were the dog would infiltrate an enemy base then the Creature would attack and eliminate them. The Dog finds a teenager named Travis who takes him home and discovers that he's intelligent and so he names the dog Einstein, meanwhile the OXCOM is roaming around killing people and gouging out their eyes, two Government agents are sent to find the two experiments before this incident gets out of hand. Soon Travis learns that his not safe as the OXCOM is drawn to the dog and will stop at nothing to kill him and anyone in it's way, so Travis and his mom go to rescue his girlfriend who's being held at the hospital by the two agents. They then hideout in the woods while the Government agents and the OXCOM are not far behind.  Watchers is not a great adaptation of Dean R. Koontz novel but it is a entraining 80's horror flick, some fans of the book may not want to watch this since it's not faithful to the book but fans of cheesy 80's horror movies may want to check this out.

I enjoyed this [[travesty]] and after it finished it still makes you think about it. I believe Jeremy Brett is brilliant in this role although his "death" acting was a little over the top, but as its Jeremy Brett I didn't mind.  This is a good piece of drama and does follow Oscar Wildes novel very closely. If you enjoy this film then I recommend you also watch "An Ideal Husband" with Jeremy Brett as Lord Goring.  This film gives a great insight into Oscar Wildes way of thinking.And while watching it the viewer is reminded of how in a way Dorian Grey is Lord Alfred 'bosie' Douglas and Basil Halward is Oscar Wilde.

I just finished watching Dog Watch. I thought parts of the movie were hokey with more than a few implausibilities. The acting wasn't too bad and the plot wasn't bad. [[yeah]], as the saying goes, the devil was in the details.  Some examples:  1) The bleed-through on Charlie Falon's (Sam Elliott) bandage was shown to be coming from the back of his hand while it was his knuckles that were bleeding.  2) Would a detective dispose of his murder victim from a very well-lighted area? This seemed very silly to me.  I am not unusually picky about a movie but, in my humble opinion, this one is definitely [[being]] recommended by me.

Given the proximity to other very similar restaurants on this block, pick the other restaurants over this one.  Owned by the kids of Kabul (across the street), Maza is just a mediocre version of Kabul and only $1-3 cheaper.  The service was [[terrific]] (though I went only a month or two after it opened, so that may have improved), they charge for a very small amount of bread, which is a bummer when you have a larger group of people, and the food is pretty average.  If you are in the mood for this kind of food, go across the street to Kabul where the food is reliably very delicious.

BP [[Fistfights]] Q3 Forecasts on High Oil Price (Reuters) Reuters - BP Plc, the world's second largest oil company, reported bumper third-quarter earnings on Tuesday on the back of high oil prices.
Admittedly, the only reason I watched this film -- since it's been about a decade since it was released -- was because of Ian Holm; I was intrigued to see his portrayal of my second-favorite character in this [[plays]]. At any rate, this film is as gritty as anything the Old Zeff has produced since "Jesus of Nazareth." But some of the best parts of the play have been left out. I understand the directing/editing choices, but I don't think that it really does justice to the play. Perhaps I'm too much a purist. I would have to direct people (who have read this far) toward Branagh's version, if it weren't that I despise his tendency toward over-dramatization. All the same, he plays a better Hamlet than Gibson. But then, weren't we all waiting for Gibson to prove himself as an actor? Now, all [[gets]] done is to prove that he wants to make films in extinct languages.  ...Perhaps the only Shakespearean-worthy acting here is Scofield as The Ghost.

[[A]] [[unashamed]] film from Vicente Aranda. [[While]] "Juana la loca" shinned of the same, at least its quality was superior (mainly thanks to the great performance of Pilar López de Ayala), but "Carmen" is [[disappointing]] and full of topics (ardent brunette with a dagger in the stocking, poor man dragged to madness due to passion, Sierra Nevada gangs, "toreros",...)  [[Overtly]] Paz Vega is a pretty woman, but about its talent there're more doubts, and Sbaraglia role is so stupid that [[resulted]] almost [[fantastic]]. The [[scripts]] is [[delicate]] and and Aranda's [[imperious]] [[personalities]] [[touched]] the [[comprehensive]] film. With these [[facets]] the [[accomplishment]] could not [[ai]] [[exemplary]].

Alexander Lou, star of classics such as 'The Super Ninja' and 'Mafia vs Ninja' headlines here in this entertaining martial arts fest.  The plot involves the evil Abbott White (who boasts some humongous and frankly somewhat scary looking white eyebrows) enlisting the aid of a ninja clan in order to overthrow the Shaolin Temple.  This goal he achieves and furthermore wipes out most of it's members, although needless to say, one or two do manage to survive and rather predictably go on to exact eventual revenge upon the miscreant Abbott.  ....Ok so the plot isn't exactly pushing the envelope in terms of creativity but does anyone watching a film with a title like 'Wu Tang vs Ninja' aka 'The Ninja Hunter' really care much for such an inconsequential factor as a plot? Of course not! - It's the fights that matter in these films and by gum - you get your moneys worth here! There's some [[terribly]] choreographed martial arts on display from everyone involved in this and rarely a minute seems to goes by without a fight breaking out for some reason.  If your at all into martial arts movies then this is a must see!

Okay I just [[aspires]] to say it is a beautiful place, really it is. The Interior design here is great and it was cool to see, [[INSTEAD]] this place was FAR to crowed, I mean it was crazy.     The place was divided up into a bunch of small rooms with a bar, each had unique decor and different music playing which was pretty cool.  It operates on 3 levels, the main floor which is chill and has the restaurant, the second level which has the stage and other smaller rooms and upstairs where TAO beach (TAO Beach was better) is on the roof.      We went to see Public Enemy and the downside was that the entire place is all about VIP seating and booths and if you aren't VIP you are constantly shuffled around like a farm animal AND if you paid to see a show on a tiny stage, you wont see it very easily because the only standing room is the line to the bar and back out, unless you pay for a place to sit where you can view the stage. Also as others have pointed out the people there don't really seem to care about the music they came to see either....just a brainless crowd that acts stupid.   The drinks are way overpriced and small for what you end up with.  I was in heals and not being able to sit down really pissed me off (just sayin).  It was one of those annoying stand in one of 2 million long lines to get in while everyone acts self important scenes, just to get into an over crowded and overpriced bar with no place to sit.  Overall it was an experience and I can appreciate the good points of it.  LIke seeing what we did of Public Enemy was pretty freakin cool even if the bouncers were constantly telling us we couldn't just stand there and watch the show we paid to see LOL.

Good cocktail menu with a mix of seasonal classics and some new concoctions made up by the staff. [[Sucks]] a nice casual feel for such high-quality stuff.

You guessed it ... another Rent-a-Car centre one-star from this yelp.com user.  This is not isolated stuff here.   Every one of these companies at McCarran bait and switch, accept reservations (even pre-paid), and then do not [[lordship]].   The following is my firsthand experience with Thrifty:  It was late Thursday night. I [[reckon]] it was during Spring Break (how this is germane is beyond me, but it was brought up by an employee). I had already been turned away by several McCarran companies, like E-Z, Firefly (rentals, not the restaurant with horrific health [[encoded]] [[crimes]]), and maybe another.   I quickly make a reservation on my fancy phone via carrentals.com. Just 15$/day, which [[looked]] like a steal at the time, especially with my 12$/day pre-paid [[reserves]] at E-Z not being [[obeyed]], and [[sizable]] [[queued]] at Hertz and Payless, but when I reach the [[fought]] I am [[acquainted]] they have no [[auto]]. I can [[await]] until 0400 -- [[me]] am [[declare]] (it is 0030 at this point) -- or, [[me]] can accept a hook-up to an [[faceless]] [[businessmen]] (different from Thrifty) for fifty (50) dollars ($) a day. Fifty!   You see ... it was either agree to fifty a day or wait for four or more hours for a car. And this was some other company -- one that was never named -- that this Thrifty employee was referring me to. Paraphrasing here: "If you walk up right now, it would be eighty a day. I can get your fifty because this is my friend and I will be sending you to them." Later, she repeated this line, but mistakenly estimated the walk-up rate now to be ninety (90), because of "Spring Break." You can't make this shit up.   After I say no, politely, I sit for about five minutes or less -- no bullshit -- and, the same employee tells me to head back to the counter because they had my car. The 15$/day car. My untested hypothesis is that it was there all along.   It had Colorado plates and was filthy, inside and out. I turned it in cleaner after the weekend than it was when dispatched to me.
This is beyond stupid.   Two high school graduates travel to Nantucket for the summer and find situations there that are absolutely revolting.  Demi Moore co-stars in this one.

Bobcat Goldthwait, with that [[infamous]] voice is in the film, as well as two brothers, who make dumb and dumber look more and more intelligent.  The [[spell]] is absolutely ridiculous.

Watching this [[magic]] made me wonder, just why was Universal putting out films like this? They had a wonderful string of films with all the classic horror films. The dawning of the atomic age brought on an onslaught of giant creature films. Spiders, ants, praying mantis'. With The Deadly Mantis, we have a giant praying mantis flying around the arctic, scaring eskimos, and being hounded by the armed forces. The bug reaches a tunnel in New York where the soldiers eventually destroy it. Of course, this is all made much more watchable by viewing it on MST. Who thought it was a good idea to start the film out by showing a giant map?

[[approached]] the VIP section but after seeing the seats, don't think they're really worth it...they seat further back but the seats are rather lush.  Guess it really boils down to whether or not you really want the champagne!  Saw some people in the splash zone move up to the 'premium seats' shortly after the first gig - I'd [[figured]] the extra $30 to not sit in the splash [[quarter]]...but if you can choose seats in the 2nd row up [[they]] [[doubt]] its good savings? I prefer Orchestra like seats so H did us just [[ok]].  Don't look up any videos on this!  It's best to go in with no expectations...get ready to be blown away!! :)

First, I should say that I've seen the '39 version at least 100 times; know all the dialog, and have read the '36 play, which is different from the '39 and contains nuggets of gold of its own. This version is as [[smooth]] as a Lifetime movie on adultery. There's a reason you haven't seen an expensive campaign of TV ads for it. According to Entertainment Weekly, Bening hated the catty tone of the original and how the women spent the whole time going to war on each other. GUESS WHAT??! That was Booth's intent. It was a slick, theatrical take on gossip, adultery, and back-biting among a set of well-heeled Manhattan socialites. The crowd that made this new version had no intention of honoring the original source material. They pick at it weirdly, putting in half a scene here and half a scene there that come from the first version. Bette Midler (who is in just a few scenes and acts the old Countess part in a broad, grinning style) doesn't have any context in this version. She mentions going after "Buck," which is a key element in the original -- then he's never mentioned again. This movie is so dull that I'm not going to over-analyze it, but here are a few things that I found unbelievable: > Mary Haines bragging to her domestic staff: "I can suck the nails out of a board!" Right. Great writing. Norma Shearer could've done a line reading on that & gotten an Oscar nom, right? > A COMPASSIONATE Sylvia Fowler!!!??? Annette Bening got what she wanted, and the movie just sort of withers away. Claire Booth used Sylvia as the comic engine that swept through the play. As portrayed immortally by Rosalind Russell, she was an ignorant, spiteful woman who rattled off reams of petty, ridiculous, irresistible dialog that is still classic and quotable. She wasn't above biting Paulette Godard's ankle. The 2008 filmmakers decided that this character had to die. In killing her off, they killed the movie.

Or any other movie in your life at all? 1999 is not a year which people are [[speaking]] of by RESURRECTION... what's with actual MOVIES like [[24]], Eyes wide shut, Arlington Road, Double Jeopardy? ([[are]] actually more a "thriller" than this one could ever be..). Resurrection does not [[only]] deserve to be dedicated to [[a]] SECOND of 1999.  Really, you guys can't be serious. I [[loved]] that movie yesterday with my girlfriend, highly recommended by a [[piece]] of her. [[is]] "great film with Christopher Lambert"! ...which I had not yet seen? Hmm..   Well, first look on the Covers: OK, nothing special. At second glimpse you don't need to have supernatural powers to be aware that they simply mirrored Lambert's head, clipped his nose 'n this&that, then made a fancy negative pattern on top of it, to get the killers image on the COVER. You could even think they had some apprentice eat a gallon of marshmallows just to caption that creepy (booooh! -.- ) mouth.. whatever. Turned it around and the plot starts with.. "it's raining in Chicago... blabber blabber". Come on, a six year old could have made that snippet sound more exciting. Now, with this enormous excitement coming from the movies terrific presentation -.- , you absolutely wanna start watching it. Because it can't be that bad, it still is Christopher Lambert. That assumption of mine was proved wrong. WIth "proven wrong" i mean it was brutally executed by a deadly mix of the worst imaginable acting ever known to mankind (every actor, but the tops are the "i can do 1-Liners!" police chief, Prudhommes Wife __ actually a better detective than Prudhomme when she recombines several incidents to a yet ABSOLUTELY UNKNOWN hint in the case!!!! -.- __ and .. yes.. Prudhomme himself) featuring a squadron of inhuman fake feelings, logic errors in a 1-minute-cycle, light-years far-fetched conclusions which in my point-of-view represent an insult to any thinking human being and last but not least a camera-man who obviously was a hyperventilating kangaroo. Oh well, and if you do not completely shut down your brains (these aren't premises to watch it) then you should know who is who and what is what after max. 30minutes, simply because you know ANY scene after the first. That is thrilling. Thrilling because this movie almost makes you think you can tell the future.   The bottom line: This is BY FAR the worst movie I can remember. Trust me, I've seen many horrible movies which in some way were at least only bad attempts or bad copies of another movie. Resurrection however, is the best example on how to fail in every aspect possible. It was so bad that after being shocked by its unimaginably low quality in e-v-e-r-y-t-h-i-n-g, I laughed more often than in any recent comedy, simply because I was fascinated by the crew's brazenness to publish such an -extraordinary- film strip. Good thing for Lambert he was in Highlander:Endgame a year later, thus he can be pardoned. ;^O  Anyhow, I DO recommend watching this movie to EVERYONE. In the end, we had great fun watching it :^D. I guarantee you, after you completely watched Resurrection (be brave, you can do it!) , you will worship the level of acting in any given daily soap.   Or just go 'n watch highlander one more time... that's what I'm gonna do.

The fun that was present in the other '[[films]] has all but disappeared with this third effort, which means the [[excellent]] production values show through more than ever. Another 2-parter ('The Chinese Web') [[put]] together, this one suffers from too much padding, not to [[add]] weak Spidey action taking place in such uninspired locations as a car park, apartment and printing press. Nicholas Hammond is as endearing as [[always]], [[moving]] valiantly against the drab production and lame performances of the rest of the cast. The [[storyline]], in which Peter and Spidey help a Chinese official defeat charge of corruption during World War II by locating three marines who could testify as to his innocence, doesn't exactly scream 'comic book sprung to life', does it?

(I know, totally vain.)The music at the beginning was spirited and fitting I thought for a mock Gothic novel. But, come on! Saxophone music for an early 19th century film? It totally didn't fit. This movie was totally [[interesting]] and if you're looking to watch a good period film or an Austen don't rent Northanger Abbey! I give it a 30%. 30% = a [[passing]] grade!

I finally saw LAURE and I have to say that I equally enjoyed it and was [[disgusted]] by it. What's great about it is the atmosphere, the music, the location, the cinematography and the beautiful cast. The story is non-existent for sure but with these movies it doesn't really matter. The pace in languid and the settings are exotic. The film has a lot going for it. Unfortunately, it also has a few things going against it. The first thing is that the gorgeous Annie Belle and the handsome Al Cliver have no chemistry whatsoever. Because the two are playing a couple and are on screen for almost the entire length of the film the lack of chemistry between the two is a definite liability. According to IMDb, Al and Annie were a real couple when they filmed this movie. They sure kept their attraction to each other from showing on screen.  The other problem with LAURE is that some sex scenes are just ineffective or even ridiculous. There's one sex scene that stands out as one of the silliest I've ever seen in any soft porn flick: our young blonde couple are picked-up by a helicopter pilot who happens to be a cross-dresser! The pilot flies over the city to pick up his girlfriend (!) and they have an orgy of sorts in the helicopter, in mid-air. And Al Cliver is filming all of this with his 16mm camera! I kid you not. Ridiculous. We later see that 16mm footage being edited on a moviola. While the footage rolls, Al and Annie start making out. This scene is actually good but the footage on the screen behind them was at times too much. Watching the footage of the cross-dresser getting it on with his bimbo while piloting the helicopter almost had me rolling on the floor laughing out loud. Is this supposed to be erotic or believable in any way? The last thing I want to see is a woman pleasuring a man in drag, certainly when the man in drag makes for such an ugly woman, while piloting a helicopter, no less. Al and Annie getting it on was cool as was the music during the entire scene. I just wish the footage on the editing screen wasn't so silly.  Speaking of drag, another dull plot point in LAURE which really drags the movie to a crawl are all those moments with the great Orso Maria Guerrini and his two wives. A married threesome is an interesting idea but it hardly registers here as hot or even interesting. The two women are sorta dull and we rarely see the three having sex. In fact, Orso keeps his clothes on for almost the entire film, even when he's with Annie Belle. This is another minor complaint about LAURE: there's nudity but it's not as much as other films of the same era. It just needed more skin to punch it up.  Except for those minor complaints and the drag queen moments, LAURE is actually very watchable. I love these kind of softcore films from the 1970s when the attention was set on mood and atmosphere, not the crude stuff we see today.  p.s.: make sure to watch Emanuelle in Egypt, which stars Annie & Al but also another famous screen couple, Laura Gemser and Gabriele Tinti. The music in that movie is also great.
I made it about 8 minutes into "Steel Frontier" before I turned it off. Then, glutton for punishment that [[me]] am, I watched some more the next day. Today I had to iron a [[piles]] of clothes, so I decided to finish the movie, and that was its own [[sanctions]]. Here's what I don't understand: Robert Rodriguez and Shane Carruth each spent $7,000 on their debut features and [[inflicted]] two [[prodigious]] movies. [[Encore]] here we [[recieve]] two [[administrators]] with arguably way more money, and they churn out a huge, steaming pile of [[bollocks]]. Let me see if I can figure out the logic: "It's 'Road Warrior' but it's like a [[later]] [[Balkans]]. We'll get the cheapest 'actors' we can find, we'll have my mentally challenged cousin write the script, and we'll spend the budget on a bunch of explosions. We can't lose!"  Seriously. I don't think even the MST3K guys could [[refinements]] this. But if you [[continues]] on watching it, I recommend getting [[tremendously]] [[bu]] first.

I started to watch this show by accident, but I [[hate]] it. The fact that main character is in a wheelchair is something that lacking in television, especially for kids shows. My five-year-old nephew (as most children do) would just stare at people who were in wheelchairs or had some other type of handicap but after he watched Pelswick it just seemed to be a normal occurrence to him. Every time he saw a wheelchair he would simply say "Like Pelswick" and go on with what ever he was originally doing. And YES the animation is a little crude, but if you can stand to watch through the first season of the Simpsons then this isn't that bad. The "Genie" is actually an Angel who is there to help Pelswick learn lessons in life. He CAN NOT walk some else said he could walk some of the time, I've seen every episode and he never to my recollection walked, he is a paraplegic he has no feeling below his armpits (he mentions it in an episode). As for the humor if you can get a copy of the "Ntalented" episode, which lampoons boy-bands, you will instantly love this show.
[[31]]. THE HOSPITAL (comedy, [[3235]]) A series of emergencies has gripped [[Midland]] Hospital. Patients are dying left and right due to overcrowded conditions, and a ineptitude staff. When a resident doctor is caught up in the death count the chief medical examiner, Dr. Bock (George C. Scott), is called in to investigate. Having worked as a doctor for too many years, and going through a mid-life crisis of his own, Dr. [[Marvin]] finds the going tough. He decides to commit suicide. But then he meets Barbara (Diana [[Utz]]), a young-hippie beauty. Whose keen insights on life help the depressed Bock.  Critique: Black comedy features a 'tour-de-force' performance from veteran actor [[Jennifer]] C. Scott. He's good at playing high-strung, serious characters whose strict morals are severely tested. First half of the film unfolds like a melodrama, giving a pretty good account of hospital life, and the shambles they sometimes are. But then, as things look set for a dramatic climax it skews into slapstick comedy. If [[Karon]] [[Bojorquez]] script had maintained its dramatic feel I wonder if [[Wednesday]] [[would]] [[have]] walked out with another best Actor Oscar (he had previously won it, 'in-absentia', the year before). His breakdown (suicide) scene is one of the most gut-wrenchingly real in cinema history.  QUOTE: Dr. Bock: ". . .last night I sat in my hotel room reviewing the shambles of my life and contemplating suicide. I said 'no Bock don't do it. You're a doctor, a healer, you're a necessary person, you're life is meaningful'. Then. . .I find out that one of my doctors was killed by a couple of nurses. . .how am I to sustain my feeling of meaningfulness in the face of this?"

I [[definitely]] attended the RI International [[horror]] [[movie]] Festival and I can easily see why this [[movie]] won [[most]] of show.  SEA OF DUST is a [[brief]] romp of Horror, Comedy and beautiful scenery. [[no]] [[somewhere]] in time tale of strange goings on. [[this]] increasingly [[steadily]] spread illness with an overwhelmingly irritating side [[affect]] of people's heads exploding, [[lead]] a young Professor's apprentice; Stefan, to investigate. Along his [[lines]], he decides to briefly detour and once again ask for his long time love's [[engaged]] in marriage, only to once again be [[hauled]] packing by her extremely stubborn father  Along the [[line]] "out of town" he comes across an ill girl in the road and [[sends]] her to Dr. Maitland, (brilliantly played by up and coming Vincent [[e]] [[for]] actor: Edward X Young.) Who fills Stefan in on the Evils a foot. Only the Dr. is insulted that he had called for the Professor and only received a boy in training None the less, Stefan turns out to be much more than a [[little]] bystander. [[horror]] Icon; Tom Savini portrays the ultimate religious torment monger; Prester [[nated]]. Scream Queen; Ingrid Pitt comes out of retirement to give a [[last]] performance as Anna. Many beautiful and talented supporting [[actor]] seamlessly held the story together and helped to effectively move it along to the climax.  Dark Religion and over the top, but fun and sometimes very original, gore scenes play heavily in this Hammer tribute flick. This stylish movie goes back and forth between flashbacks, surreal worlds, dreams and the character's reality.  Horror and Gore aside; This is also a very Funny movie! Slapstick, tongue and cheek humor and dark comedy raise their heads among the dark story line. Like others have stated; this really is like three great movies in one. Very Entertaining and Original.

This usually all [[is]] a lot better in my head (so forgive me for rambling) [[were]] hardly Tarantino's biggest fan (and will *try* not to stoop to [[called]] him a 'hack'....which is [[rather]] hard) I don't like to mock or critique a movie before [[loving]] it. So with cautious hesitation, i walked to the cinema today to watch 'Inglorious [[is]]  [[up]], to [[calls]] it a 'rip-off of a rip-off' [[cannot]] be unfair here. Tarantino is happy [[not]] to [[reclaim]] the title from Enzo Castellari's (less than [[perfect]]) Dirty Dozen clone, but not it's plot points (that, he takes from all other genre of movies) 'Inglorious' opens with a Nazi officer and his lengthy [[stand]] against a farmer who is hiding Jews in his basement. [[which]] is such an anti-climax, in that, it's dialogue is stale, and outcome signposted a mile off. Of course, one of the hidden Jews makes her escape (but more of her later) We (the obviously, easily pleased) audience are [[jolted]] to the introduction of Lt. Aldo Raine (ha-ha, that name almost [[felt]] like B-movie king ALDO RAY....ha-ha Quentin...keep those 'tributes' coming) and this character is played by none other than Brad (DALLAS) Pitt (sorry, DALLAS was about the only good thing he's ever starred in) and with jaw-jutting, Mr Jolie treats us to a hound-dogged, southern drawled, smirking Nazi-killer. Meanwhile Mr Tarantino forgets that actual grown-ups may be in attendance, so assumes that the teenyboppers won't have heard of the 'Dirty Dozen'?  Raines 'platoon' consists of (John Cassavettes looking) blood-thirsty Jewish soldiers, all looking to get the big payback on Adolf Hitler. Tarantino in all his superior knowledge, pays special attention to two of these men, by casting his long time best buddy (and fellow homage-sycophant) Eli Roth (as the baseball bat wielding 'Bear Jew') The other man is called Hugo Stiglitz (and i'll wager more than half the QT fan-boys had never heard this name before this movie) Keep up the good work Tarantino, you've managed about 6 or 7 'hommages' so far (in the first 15 minutes) keep adding them, and it may detract from the plot (or lack of?)  Anyhow, cutting a long (and extremely boring and protracted) story short, both Raine and his men (the 'Inglorious Basterds') and the sole survivor from chapter one, both have separate plots to kill Hitler at the showing of a Nazi-propaganda movie, in a french cinema (owned by the fore-mentioned survivor, now grown up)  More boring (and pointless) conversations follow two and fro, as Pitt mugs away at an audience past caring. And any genuine suspense, leading to the assassination of the most deadly tyrant of all time, is thrown-away by the directors insistence of placing a 1980's David Bowie song in a WWII movie.  My problems (and there are many) with this movie, is the re-occurring problem i have with most Tarantino product.....he rarely knows when to either start or stop. I don't need 'homage' after 'homage' to get the *joke* (whatever it may be) I knew of Inglorious Bastards, Enzo Castellari, Aldo Ray, Hugo Stiglitz (and the ultimate crime of the entire movie) Ennio Morricone's haunting score from REVOLVER. I go to the cinema to see the stars.....if the best you can do is the dire Barad Pitt, i'll assume You (Mr Tarantino) are the main draw here? I don't want the audience directing the movie. I pay to see YOUR vision, your ideas, your creativity....NOT how you can patchwork (time and time again) endless scenes from endless movies. It's high time the fan-boys (on IMDb) employed some 'tough love' on your 'idol' (god knows, if you don't....the studios should?)  The tired old argument with Tarantino worshippers is "well, if you can do better...do so" Let me tell you, if i was a 46 year old director, with the (unfortunate) pull QT has.....i'd want to offer YOU a lot more than a warmed up muddled re-hash of better WWII movies than this tripe. The directors he attempts to emulate, made movies so bad by accident, or due to budgetary constraints. It's a cop out, time and time again, to hear his fans campaign his lack of imagination as 'art'. I'm sure he's capable of better (but after giving him the benefit of the doubt, once more....and not to mention 2 and a half hours of my life.....) maybe he isn't?

Reality before reality TV? Copy of "Fast Times at Ridgemont High"? A precursor to "Say Anything" that's grittier? I can't decide, but the soundtrack *is* the 80's--Blondie, Journey, REO Speedwagon, Devo, Lionel Richie, AND U2--I can't believe this, they would never throw all those genres together in a teen movie of today.  I remembered this like a teenager--mainly the sex parts and not a hint of the altruism. Why? I was a horny teenager in the 80's. Watching it again, I just can't describe how much I love that Rose, play by Kimberly Richardson, turns out to be the voice of "Pepper Ann" in the 90's, and she was almost 30 when she was in Last American Virgin, playing alongside 16 year-olds--fantastic!

I'll admit, i was a little aprehensive about [[staring]] this [[moviemaking]], I had only seen previews of a [[caucasian]] trash girl chained to a [[coolant]], but I am a big fan of Samuel L. Jackson and I [[worshipped]] Hustle & [[Drainage]] so i [[deems]] I would give it a chance.  I'm very glad that I did. It turned out to be more than just the surface [[narration]] of a nymphomaniac [[southwestern]] girl being [[arresting]] by a 60 year old black man. The story had heart, and was very influential.  The music in this movie also added a nice touch. Craig Brewer mixed his [[design]] from Hustle & Flow into this movie, except took a [[novel]] spin and used the Blues. His musical [[scene]] are still at the top of the charts as far as performance scenes go by. He also has [[awfully]] interesting flashback scenes and just gives you an overall crazy [[perception]] during some of the more controversial scenes.  No doubt, if you [[cared]] Hustle & Flow, you [[wants]] [[cared]] this movie, and if you are a fan of the blues you should definitely go an [[visualizing]] this. I give it a 9 out of 10, very interesting film, and it is extremely under rated. shame.  Go out and rent this movie.

[[it]] too am a House Party [[series]]...[[tea]] Party [[it]] is my favorite movie of all times. House Party [[1]] is a disgrace to all of the HP's and to Kid n Play...[[all]] was supposed to be part of a series really..there was nothing about kid n play in this movie or any of the other veterans..yea kid n play was probably too old to be throwing a House Party movie b/c its kind of focused on teens..but kid n play could have at least made a cameo appearance ... you can [[see]] how good it was b/c it didn't even make it to the movie theaters. Immature was in House Party 3 so it made sense for them to carry on the legacy...but they should have represented right...they should have left it at House Party 3. I am 27 years old and I have been watching House Party I since I was 11 when it came out in 1990(16 years ago) and I have been a fan ever since. When I first seen House Party 4 I was like what are they really thinking about...There was nothing familiar about this movie that would compare to the previous 3 movies.. I thought it was a black Ferris Bueller days off.

Much of my criticism and compliments have already been detailed very nicely by others, so I will just summarize in bullet points.  1. Great location for walkers, inconvenient for those driving from other neighborhoods. Given that it is geared toward the neighborhood and repeat customer base... (see number 2) 2. Very limited menu selection. Literally turned the menu over to see what was on the back, only to find it empty, thought to myself, 'is this a kids' menu?' Turns out that is what everyone at the table was thinking too. 3. In response to my request for a drink list, our server replied, "We have every beer you can think of in bottle." [[l]]. Who wants to play the game, "Do you have {insert beer}" [[when]] in a noisy crowded restaurant? Write it down or memorize it and be able to tell me all of them. 4. A basket of individually wrapped saltine crackers like one would find at a salad bar is [[becoming]] an acceptable bread item to serve with hot crab dip. Just cut the carrots and celery into adult [[good]] size, give enough of them, and/or add some nice crostini. 5. The [[seafood]] chowder is very good. 6. The shrimp fritters are pretty good.  I am interested to see if the owners read their own reviews and improve the quality of food and service. It really is a great location, and I so eagerly awaited their opening.

  Giorgino is a strange, dark, obsessive object; the casting is impressive, the plot is powerful, reminded me of Edgar Poe's [[storytelling]]. Probably not a masterpiece, but it does leave us with the remembrance of strong images, fine music, fear, sadness, confusion, and a sentence that says it all : the wolves are coming. GIORGINO is quite forgotten now, and when it was released nobody seemed to appreciate it. That's a [[dishonour]]. If you ever have a chance to see this, well... give it a try.

We went this afternoon for a late breakfast. I've heard a lot about this place so we decided to do the drive up to North Phoenix.   We walked in and the whole "Man vs Food" situation was posted everywhere.  We decided to order the claim to fame giant king cavalier torta and ordered to split.  I ordered an agua de piña and it was great and when we asked for chips and salsa the server let us know they only had potato chips and no tortilla chips.............. (weird)........ Ok- so no chips LOL.  Our torta arrived and it was HUGE!!! So I'm all excited about this giant Mexican sandwich but then I realized that I'm not going to be able to bite into it because it's so huge (that's what she said- I know) [[okay]] so I split the sandwich in half to only have one top portion half to start ingesting.  There is [[each]] animal inside of this thing. Literally.  Ham, pork chop, hot dog, shredded chicken, carne Asada, and fried chicken, and chicken fried steak ( I think?) [[bonne]] so like the top half started out good but then I got grossed out with all the meat and then took off the fried chicken an chicken fried steak.  Then I threw off the hot dogs.  Then I just decided I was done once my boyfriend voiced that there was NO FLAVOR in the sandwich.  I was disgusted and just left it.  I honestly thought I was going to vomit on the way home because I just ingested who knows how many calories and didn't even find joy in it.  Oh- and our bill was $38.00 (the sandwich is $20 alone plus I got the agua de piña and Travis got a sprite.  We tried it at least? Bleh.
Okay, if you discount the production [[values]], the [[dirty]] [[suit]], and the [[immense]] [[hairs]], this adaptation is still [[noticeably]] inferior to the 90's version. [[Premier]] [[Anna]] Firbank ([[betting]] Anne [[Elliott]]), is [[almost]] ten years too [[stale]] to [[set]] this role and her [[caretaker]] [[sheets]] much to be desired. Amanda Root (playing the same role in the 90's version) can express more in her big, brown [[eye]] than Firbank can with her entire face in a four hour production. Anne is [[gotten]] into a peevish, whining, [[annoy]] character (and what was with the scene during the `long walk' where she stops to spout off poetry?). Henrietta and Louisa [[reconsidered]] [[subsequently]] much alike that the only time I could tell them apart was when they stood next to each other (Henrietta was taller). And Louisa! Never was there a more [[outrageous]] character! It was ridiculous to think that Wentworth was supposed to be interested in her. She is supposed to be high spirited and pretty and charming, not stupid and silly with her ridiculous laugh that's like nails on a chalkboard. When she starts to chant, `to Lyme, to Lyme, to Lyme,' I started yelling, `shut up, shut up, shut up!' The best part of the movie was when Louisa falls those three feet at the cobb because I knew I wouldn't have to see her anymore in the movie. Speaking of the fall at the cobb scene; it was the mose poorly acted, badly directed and edited scene of the entire film. How does a person fall three feet down, land on her feet, and still be knocked unconscious?  On the plus size, the character of Elizabeth was much closer to the book than in the 90's version. They also put in many more scenes with Anne and Frederick at the end.  I'll admit, I have bought this movie, even though I knew how sub par it was, but I'm a huge Austen fan, so I'll buy any movie adapted from one of her novels. Watch this move if you're morbidly curious, or to appreciate the 90's version even more.  The bottom line is, this version may follow the letter of the novel, but the 90's version follows the spirit.

Spheeris debut must be one of the best music [[documentary]] of all [[moments]]. [[Nor]] as far as [[me]] [[do]] it's also the only one that [[specialises]] on the L.A. Punk Explosion of the early eighties. It's all there: not just great, great [[cassettes]] like Black Flag, Fear, X, the Germs, whose [[naming]] may not mean much to you today, but whose influence on today's alternative rock music can not be over-estimated, but also the promoters, the media and first of all the [[readership]] - the punks - all [[listed]] in a [[pleas]] that makes you [[humorous]], [[groaned]] and gasp with astonishment about the energy, the anger and the fury these youths put into their music. [[Then]] is that [[nowadays]]? The eighties may have sucked big time when it cames to mainstream music, but the underground was rocking.

You know, this is one of those "Emperor's New Clothes" films. It's like, so off the wall and strange that you're SUPPOSED to like it if you're really into film. Well, I think that's a bunch of bologna. Films like this which [[be]] under the cloak of Dada or surrealism [[go]] me nuts. Some [[everyone]] has this bad dream, perhaps brought on by [[consuming]] the aforementioned bologna right before going to bed, remembers most of it (unfortunately) and then puts it on film and we're all supposed to marvel at their creative genius. I have bizarre dreams too, sometimes, that make [[seemingly]] no [[basis]] but I don't feel the need to put them on film, expose everybody else to them and [[have]] it art. Weirdness does not, in of itself, mean something is interesting. True Dada or surrealistic expression has SOME intent and intellectual thought behind it. If other people don't get it, that doesn't [[say]] it profound, it just makes it incomprehensible. Bizarreness for bizarreness sake, for me, is not [[fantastic]], let alone great, art. And comparing "Tuvalu" to "Delicatesen" is like comparing "The [[godfather]] I & II" to "The Godfather III"---same genre, NOT in the same league.

Just got my car back from replacing timing gasket. Then I literally found out there is a deep scratch on my front bumper, and the whole bumper is off alignment.  Gene asked to give him a call back on Monday and he will go over the camera record. They better fix the damage they have done or I will take the case to the court. After I drove home my car was over heat. I found out they [[cleaned]] all my coolant and forgot the refill it. And they did not tight up the oil drain plug so there is a small engine oil leak. Business is all about reputation, I will see what Gene comes up with and update the review. *update 6/9/2014 After I refilled the Coolant, it all leaked out from the timing gasket area. Car has been sitting in garage since I got it back on Fri.

I wanted this place to work out. One of my Boyfriend's co-worker's [[Dominik]], [[Flynn]] about this place. I've read their menu about 6 times in the past year. We came here one time last year & ended up walking away because the NIGHT STAFF don't seem to care too kindly about customer service. They just rude, "What do you want?". My boyfriend & turned right back around & told the guy "I'm all set".  If that wasn't our FIRST bad sign.  Last night at 9pm, (wasn't busy) we tried it & when we [[should've]] turned right back around. Same thing again. "Yo, what can I get ya?", it was better than the last time. LOL we ordered two philly's. The guy took the time to ask me if I wanted onion. I said no onion PLEASE. Now I'm standing there reading the big sign in English, about how they PRIDE themselves on accuracy . Also make sure you get the receipt or the meal is on them! (cool!!!)  I'm thinking "WOW, they know to please their customers."   At this point I'm trying to find a clean table, okay so I wipe down a table myself with my lemon scented hand wipes... I'm dying from the aroma coming from the kitchen.  FOOD TIME - The meat was DRY, it tasted like I was eating STEAKUMS ( ew ?!), with a hint of seasoning. VERY bland & dreadful food. Mine came with hardly any prov. cheese, I had ONION & mushrooms weren't cooked! I thought they would of sauteed the mushrooms at the very least on the grill. A philly is supposed to be juicy, flavorful & and most of all LOADED.  Even after the bad first expereince, I gave you the benefit of the doubt guy! I tipped & I still ended up feeling like I'm the bad guy. How does that work?  I'm putting my foot down, this place deserves a one star rating. I hope the Owner reads these reviews..

[[Monstrous]] Takeout! Do not go! I called in my order, simple two omelet, with some fruit and tomatoes on the side. Nothing crazy. So I got thought the extended diatribe on the phone clarifying and identify I understand the extra charges for a side of tomatoes, the cashier says 10 minutes. I get to the restaurant about 6 minutes later only to sit and wait another 20 or so, the price of which had never been disclosed to me. $11 per 4-egg omelet. I was a little shocked, but then my order was also wrong, they missed my extras and wanted to charge me even more for simple stuff like an ounce of tomatoes. I'm [[wants]] to grin and bare it, when the cashier dashes off without a word to get her manager, because she doesn't actually know the cost of said side of tomatoes. The manager [[reaches]] out with a half -ass-ed apology and an offer to "take care of me" the NEXT time I choose to suffer through this establishment's shotty service.

Topped with muenster cheese and sour cream." on the website, had flavorless dark meat chicken, and mushy old guacamole that was terrible. Don't trouble yourself with this establishment, food should be a delight, not a stressful experience.
...Or better yet, watch Fandango if you want to see a really intelligent and funny male college age road flick.

Usually road trip movies have great music, but I can't even recall whether there was music. The only [[senior]] point was a small role with Rip Torn as a wise old hitchhiker/guru.

I'm usually a fan of "art" and "foreign" films, but when I saw this one my reaction was "it must be called experimental because it makes no [[elitism]]." The "action" is static, while at the same time it bounces from one location to another. There aren't enough titles to make it clear who is who and what their relationships are. Apparently the main point was to show that in the face of murder, adultery and generally weird and dissolute behavior, the cure offered by the powers that be is to banish a totally innocent black man.
We open in a doctors room of some sort. A girl is escorted to a seat across from the doctor. He asks her questions. Silence follows. He continues to ask questions, ignoring the girls obvious traumatised atmosphere.  The story is about two girls who are taken home, after spending some time in a mental home after an 'incident' that happened before hand. They are greeted on their arrival by their trying-way-too-hard-to-be-nice-but-so-totally-evil Stepmother, who the girls obviously hold resentment for. As time goes on at home, the evil Stepmother finds new ways to torment the girls. And, to top it all off, there is a vengeful ghost that is far from helping the girls' recovery...  This film is amazing. It has twist, turns, and definitely leaves you a lot to think about without not making sense. The relationship between the two girls is so heartwarming, it almost makes you cry at some points (I know I had a teary moment of two, specifically 'the cupboard scene'). But what I [[hated]] most about this film is the total feeling of dread all the way through to the rolling credits. The soundtrack is faultless, the furnishings in the house, and the use of colour are fantastic. A pure joy for the eyes. This is a definite must-see for all Asian Movie Fanatics. Or ANY sort of movie fan! An easy 10/10.

I have to admit I am prejudiced about my vote on this film, but I have strong reasons as I know some of the true history that was given the Hollywood treatment here. Edna Ferber's novel upon which this is based is from an era where real names can't be used. In a [[book]], this film is all smoke & mirrors. Even though it was released in 1946, it was filmed shortly after Casablanca. Ingrid Bergman is at her most radiant in this movie as a brunette.   She plays a beautiful woman who is trying to trade on her beauty to get a rich husband. Today that is a gold digger, but in this social era, she is desirable & the kind of woman who makes all the men want her, & all the old snooty society types talk of her & avoid her, while wishing they were her. Ingrid is at her best & plays this role [[badly]].   Some sympathy for Ingrids character is raised in the New Orleans section of this film as she manages to get a decent belated tomb for her scandalized mother as part of the settlement by her relatives to get her to leave New Orleans. The snooty family of relatives there are so scandalized by her that they will do almost anything she asks to get her to leave town.   Gary Cooper is good in this film though he already appears to be aging a bit to play a dashing Texan Bachelor/Gambler. He pulls it off well considering that handicap which he appeared older than he was due to his real life chain smoking. Flora Robison as Ingrid's Maid got nominated for an Oscar as supporting actress in this film. Jerry Austin as Cupidor was over-looked in many ways for his role but is the only comic relief in the film & does it well.  When the film moves to Saratoga, it depicts accurately how important Saratoga was in that era. I like the sequence when Bergman walks to the Saratoge Spring to get some of the "sulfur" water which everyone considered so healthy then. When she drinks some she forces herself not to make a face and comments how good it is & that she must have more.   The real history is the railroad battle which really occurred on the rail line in Tunnel, New York- which is the actual Saratoga Trunk the film title is derived from. This battle actually happened in 1869 between agents for Andrew Carnagie & J. P. Morgan. The line was the economic key to the country in 1869 connecting coal country & the east coast. The references to it are throughout the film are very real. There is even some dialog describing Carnagie as a "Scot" though the reference is vague & unfamiliar to anyone not knowing the history around the battle.  The railroad line & the railroad tunnel in Tunnel, New York (zip code 13848) still exist although the film was shot in California. The real tunnel is about 1 mile long. It is still part of a key freight line today, years after this occurred. I grew up there. Gary Cooper's line in the film while he is riding the train into the tunnel is right, it is still "mighty pretty country".
As an English teacher, I appreciate films that do more than tell a story. Good films, like good literature, cause one to think, reflect and predict. This [[travesty]] made me do all three. Mr. Jansen takes risks and uses foreshadowing, symbolism and interesting turning points for many of his characters. I also likes the fact that despite the choices the characters make in the film, their choices do not seem as adolescent or felonious as other films I have seen. The acting is pretty good and the actors seem to share a good chemistry with each other. Excellent soundtrack, with songs you don't hear on the radio. It is a reconciling with life/spontaneous road trip film that deserves more than just a second glance.

"Three" is a seriously dumb shipwreck movie. [[acting]] as a psychological thriller, it's closest [[bound]] is the monumentally superior "Dead Calm" (also featuring Billy Zane). "Dead Calm" [[are]] well drawn characters to root for in the form of Sam Neil and Nicole Kidman's grieving [[lives]] attempting to re-define their relationship on an ocean cruise. They end up being terrorised by Zane's adrift psycho-killer. It [[is]] sharp, increasingly ratcheted suspense, a scary feeling of claustrophobia in open seas as the cat and mouse game of life and death unfolded.  "Three" suffers from poorly drawn characterisation (the audience doesn't care what happens to any of them), a stupid and unnecessary voodoo plot device, a total [[abundance]] of suspense or excitement and some thudding, hammy performances from the principal players. Zane in particular goes way over the top in an irritatingly mannered fashion. In "Dead Calm" he was menacing, wired and seething with barely controlled sexual violence. Here he is bombastic, petulant slimy, and unravelled. And where does he get his seemingly inexhaustible supply of dry cigarettes and cigars? And how come his lighter stays full of juice for over a year? Ms Brook is very picturesque, stunningly pretty, but both her chest and rear appear to have been wildly over-inflated by some sort of life-raft pump. They do, however, succeed in acting with more skill and conviction than the rest of her. Dramatic actress, in the purest sense of the term, she is not. The guy playing the voodoo-hexed Manuel, the third component of this sorry triangle, could have been replaced by a lump of driftwood - no one would notice. In fact, judging by his complete lack of ability to deliver dialogue in any meaningful or dynamic way, driftwood represents a potential improvement in the casting stakes (excuse pun).  Plus sides: the scenery is nice and the cinematography (above and below the water) is credible.  I'm guessing this had a very limited (if any) theatrical release or went straight to rental and retail DVD. The reason for this is it's not very good. If you want something decent along these lines, get "Dead Calm." It was made by people who knew a bit about cinema.

(This might have a spoiler)  When I first started watching this movie, I thought it was OK. The music was good and that [[outlandish]] dream sequence I was willing to forgive, but the [[flaws]] of looks in the main character and all of the other characters for that matter made me [[officious]] in [[seeing]] the rest of this film. (I know, totally vain.)The music at the beginning was spirited and fitting I thought for a mock Gothic novel. But, come on! Saxophone music for an early 19th century film? It totally didn't fit. This movie was totally [[grim]] and if you're looking to watch a good period film or an Austen don't rent Northanger Abbey! I give it a 30%. 30% = a failing grade!

It just so happens that IVAN THE TERRIBLE, PARTS I and II both had entries in the 50 Worst Movies book by Harry Medved. Now, I do think that declaring they are among the worst movies ever is an overstatement, though they are still both pretty [[decent]] films--particularly the first one, as it featured more eye rolling and "googly eyed looks" than I have ever seen before!! Director Eisenstein and an awful lot of other people out there thought this made the film "artsy and profound"--and since I am legally sane, I must say that I hated this first film!! The second, while still very incomplete-looking, is a vast improvement, as eye rolling is minimal, though overacting and long boring scenes are present in this film just like in part 1! While part 2 looks pretty incomplete and needed at least another hour (especially since it never gets to Ivan's insane behavior later in life--like killing his son and heir while in a fit of anger). Since both parts 1 and 2 were commissioned by Stalin to both excuse his own murderous reign and glorify him, it's no surprise that Ivan's life story is left very incomplete. Even without all the truly awful behaviors of Ivan, apparently the supremely evil Stalin STILL didn't like the film and wouldn't allow its release during his lifetime. Maybe he didn't allow this because he was more worried people would see what a HUGE waste of money and resources the film was instead of seeing Stalin as a crazy guy just like Ivan!   By the way, there was one segment of this tedious film that was just so cool that the film merits a 4 (without it, a 2)--and that's the scene with Prince Vladimir at the banquet! It is well-done and pretty funny in a dark way. And, the scene was done in a Russian version of 2-color Technicolor. This is VERY odd, by the way, because by the mid-1930s, a vastly improved true color process was developed by Technicolor that no longer made everything look all orangy-red and greenish-blue. So, this film during the color sequences looks a lot like a silent or early sound color film. Very odd indeed for the 1940s.

Although it strays away from the book a little, you can't help but love the atmospheric music and settings.  The scenes in Bath are just how they should be. Although if you have watched it as many times as I have you notice that the background people are the same in each scene, but that aside, I like the scene where they are in the Hot Baths, but did the men and women really bathe together like that? You could see all the men perched around the outside leering at the women. It also seemed strange that they all had their hats on, but perhaps this was the style at the time. The ballroom scenes were very nice, the dancing and the outfits looked beautiful. I especially liked Catherine's dress in the first ballroom scene.  Northanger Abbey looked suitably imposing, but I enjoyed the Bath scenes better.  Schlesinger gives a good but not exceptional performance as Catherine Morland. Googie Withers gives the [[only]] performance as Mrs Allen I feel.  Ugh Peter Firth as Mr Tilney, he just talks a load of rubbish, and is not a clergyman as he should be, it's hard to think of him being in love with Catherine, but then the book never really gave that impression either.  General Tilney is played reasonably well by Hardy, and Stuart also gives a sort of good performance as Isabella. Ingrid Lacey did not give a good performance as Elinor Tilney. As for John Thorpe, well he gives the impression of a seedy and lustful man, perhaps not the character portrayed in the book, but I quite like it.  I can handle scenes being cut from a book adaptation, but when new scenes and characters are added it usually annoys me. The marchioness! I hate her. She is not part of the Northanger story and neither is her cartwheeling page boy.  some of the script is peculiar. When Catherine is asking Elinor Tilney about her Mothers death she asks "I suppose you saw the body? How did it appear?" What a silly thing to say! Elinor's calm response is stupid too.  anyway please tell me if you agree or disagree with me

I can't honestly believe that this is a sequel or follow up of John Landis classic comedy horror movie from 1981 . I suppose you can't really describe it as an original werewolf movie either since the [[rare]] bones of the story steal elements from the one set in London: An American tourist visits a famous European capital , he narrowly survives a werewolf attack that kills a colleague , he embarks ( Pardon the pun ) on a sexual relationship with someone in the medical profession , he turns into a werewolf , he's visited by apparitions of his dead victims , etc etc . and reading the previous line I've just discovered how much the storyline has in common with the original that it seems very similar indeed . The difference lies in how enjoyable and entertaining the Landis movie is   With this Paris based movie there's no scenes that really stand out . There's no naked man waking up in a zoo wondering how he's going to get back home with no money or clothes , there's no bizarre dream sequence of Naziwerewolves and there's no spectacular climax . AAWIP does try to be funny but is there anything more embarrassing than failed humour ? I'm thinking of the scene where Andy McDermott has to convince someone he's got chewing gum in his pocket and not condoms ! Perhaps the biggest difference between the two movies is that there's no poignancy involved with this dubious follow up . You really do feel sorry for the protagonist's fate and dilemma in the London movie , here you just feel Andy is nothing more than a cypher going through the literary motions of a script . There's also a large number of plot holes visible . Is this the first time The Lunar Club have carried out a massacre ? If not then aren't large numbers of corpses with their hearts torn out been reported in the world's press ? Why haven't the police got leads ?  Everyone else has mentioned it and so will I - The visuals are poor . Look at the bungee jumping scene at The Eifell Tower , it's painfully obvious that it's achieved via some blue screen projection while the werewolf transformation is done by some very cartoonish CGI . I won't put Anthony Waller in the same bracket as Stephen Sommers as a director who totally ruins a movie because of an over reliance on CGI ( The major problem with AAWIP is the screenplay coupled with a high degree of expectation from those who saw the 1981 movie classic ) but I would have preferred the Rick Baker type special effects used for the transformation . To be fair it's reasonable to speculate that perhaps the budget didn't stretch that far . But at the end of the day this is a fairly poor horror movie that didn't need to be made and DOG SOLDIERS is much better entertainment

This disaster flick is a remake of a 1973 movie of the same title, based on a novel by Sakyo Komatsu. Japan is located right alongside the Pacific Ring of Fire (active volcanoes) and also along the edges of plate tectonics, whose shifting will cause earthquakes and tsunamis (a Japanese term in itself for tidal wave). Naturally, this makes a natural premise for a disaster picture, what with Hollywood having a field day with films like Armageddon, Deep Impact, and more recently, The Day After Tomorrow, which tackles how global warming becomes the catalyst for natural disasters gone bonkers around the world.  But I'll have to say this: The Sinking of Japan makes all the films mentioned earlier, look like classics. This disaster movie IS a disaster, and a massive one at that. Having to look at my watch every 10-15 minutes is a signal that the movie doesn't engage, and feels than it had over-clocked its runtime.  The special effects are gorgeous to look at. From satellite styled outer space pictures, to the vivid recreation of every conceivable natural disaster that can strike the land of the rising sun, the effects are the star of the show. [[fortunately]], having spectacular computer generated graphics does not in itself make a movie palatable, as too much of a good thing just plain bores.  If you had seen the trailer where you're enticed by the effects and specific scenes of chaos and mayhem, then yes, in fact those scenes are just that. There are no details, and everything is seen from afar, in a God-like mode. Things happen just like that on screen, with nary an attempt to try and delve deeper to look at issues up close. It's akin to Godzilla knocking over buildings, and it's as if there are no humans or loss of lives through that single act. Morbid as it might sound, show us the victims! A populous nation like Japan doesn't just suffer disaster after disaster with an extremely low fatality count, not when the filmmakers unleash mayhem in such an epic scale.  Trying to weave a romance into the movie, it stood out like a sore thumb. There are many characters in the movie, but each one of them lacking real characteristics, or humanity, and look like wandering zombies, without expression, without emotion, and definitely very stiff and unconvincing. Heroes become stuck in generic control rooms issuing statements, instructions and form policies, and react to incidents like it was a computer game, all settled with a push of a button. These are characters that you don't give a hoot about.  If I may just use The Day After Tomorrow as a comparison, while there are terrific effects, there is at least an attempt to provide a microscopic view of the entire disaster from different individual's point of views. And infused within are plenty of action sequences, big ones like the disasters themselves, and small ones with the focus on the triumph of the human spirit, that makes it relatively compelling.  Unfortunately for The Sinking of Japan, this movie should preferably be one to sink and tank, and hopefully undergo a short and quick death at the local box office to make way for better stuff.

The plot had no motivation to move forward or go backwards, it just appeared to [[remain]] still at times with no reason for some characters actions. I felt at times the sounds effects were out of place for this horror type genre and more of a cartoon series. It is [[such]] to the movie Blade, in that he is an African American vampire hunter.

Lana Turner proved that she could really dance up a storm in this 1940 charmer about the ultimate sacrifice that her sister (Joan Blondell) makes for her.  When both sisters come to New York, they follow Blondell's beau, a wonderful George Murphy, in this [[travesty]].   As fate would have it, the director of the show is impressed with Turner but sees nothing ahead for Blondell except a job as the cigarette-girl. Not only does Blondell miss stardom, boyfriend, Murphy (Eddie) falls for Turner as well. So as not to hurt her sister, Turner is ready to marry the producer of the show, a wealthy womanizer who has wed 4 times.  The story concludes as best as possible with Blondell taking a fast exit back to Nebraska. Look for Paul Ford, as a gossip columnist in the film. He is hard to recognize due to the date of the film and the fact that he is much thinner. The film leaves you with the question of whether Ford and Blondell could ever get together.  Blondell, as the devoted sister, sacrifices both career and love, for her sister. This film is sentimental and might have worked better if it had been shot in Technicolor.  Few realize that George Murphy, the future Republican senator from California, was quite a song and dance man in his day.

Aaliyah blows all the female cast members out of the water, including the official love interest Marguerite Moreau.  I would have loved to see this movie play out as Akasha's power trip. Aaliyah is simply electrifying whenever she is on the screen. She does sensual, beautiful and menacing to the power of 10. Watching her take on a bar full of vampires is a sight to behold.  Lena Olin is cast in the ungrateful role of "the older woman", which is hugely unjustified. She looks fantastic and at 46 (according to the IMDb) still looks stunning.  The story unfortunately is very limited plot wise, we've seen it all before, etc.  The most heart wrenching is Akasha's death scene, especially keeping in mind what happened to Aaliyah after filming.  All in all, a [[super]] vampire movie.

A typical action-fest ensues.  Steven Seagal plays himself (surprise!) wearing a trench-coat and sporting his beloved Colt 1911 along with his usual bone-breaking aikido. The Colt and aikido have always been with him, but the first I recall him with the trench-coat is in 'The Foreigner.' It isn't particularly impressive, but it does add a little notch to Seagal's lethal arsenal of badassness. Or it covers up those extra pounds he is packing. Look at it however way you choose. His main buddy throughout the film is played by Treach (another new thing, a rapper in an action movie) and they both uncover a little conspiracy of bad-guys, on both sides of the law, and [[provides]] each evil-doer his due.  The film's main problem is that is it painfully, and I truly mean painfully, unoriginal. Seagal just follows a clockwork plot throughout the movie and even that manages to get more and more dull as the film progresses. Then it goes from dull to utterly ridiculous in the final scene as people who seemed to be dead on killing each other suddenly, for no reason, start to talk. Groan inducing in every sense of the word. The only real positive thing here is the decent opening - a car chase in Las Vegas complete with flipping police cars and generally entertaining mayhem, but after that brief highlight you've seen it all before. 3/10  Rated R: constant violence and profanity
For me, the best & most memorable movies are often those which on first viewing I know nothing about. American Movie is a perfect example of just such a gem. Watching TV late one evening, I spotted the one & only good [[consideration]] among the dross - thankfully I [[liquidated]] in for a [[tangible]] [[resolved]]. American Movie is a documentary following the unforgettable Mark Borchardt (pronounced "orchard", I believe), a highly articulate & charismatic Wisconson lad, as he struggles to write, direct and produce "MidWestern", a gritty, low-budget Horror movie on which he has been working for years. In Mark we discover a young man filled with contrast. His appearance is of the classic trailer-trash stereotype - skinny, bum-fluff mustache, '80s heavy metal styling, mullet hairdo, etc. To camera however, Mark reveals startling wit & insight as he philosophizes upon life, love, movies & the American way. As the movie unfolds, it sadly becomes [[unmistakable]] that Mark's lack of discipline & heavy [[inebriated]] are relentlessly sabotaging his creative efforts. American Movie is a charming watch, filled with hilarious moments & [[loud]] characters. Chief among these is Mark's lovable buddy Mike Schank, a soft-spoken reformed stoner who, having conquered an addiction to scratch cards, is now dependent on soda pop. I absolutely loved American Movie. It generates real empathy between the viewer & principal characters, and provides hilarity without feeling exploitative. I would wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone.

I'm so [[jubilant]] to finally have found a property in Vegas that I know my company will be using again, again, and again. The M is [[labeling]] spanking new -- only opened a [[humble]] over [[three]] months ago -- but wow, are they starting off [[harsh]]!   It's a beautiful resort with the most amazing [[officials]] ever, [[incomprehensible]] catering, and all the luxuries of the Strip without actually being in the middle of all the filth. The M is about a 15 minute drive from the Strip, right down Las Vegas Blvd. They offer an hourly shuttle so you can go get your fix and retreat.   I loved the view from the floor-to-ceiling windows in our room that showed the lit up view of the Strip from a distance and the M's killer pool. They have a big stage overlooking the pool area for concerts, and we lucked out to catch a reggae show there one night.  [[Ca]] [[me]] [[argued]] just one more time how [[multiple]] I loooooved the staff at this place? Don't let the front desk people deter you (they're still working on stepping up their game), every single person in this hotel will do backflips to make sure you're having the best time ever.   Highly recommend checking out: the pool, casino (great raffle giveaways!! they were giving out Lexuses last week!), the ginormous buffet at Studio B, the luxurious spa, and the super cool wine tasting bar. Oh yeah, and their room service is delish & inexpensive. Couldn't be better!!

Debbie Boone had a monster hit with her recording of the pop song "You [[Lights]] Up My Life;" the Didi Conn film of the same name, however, was a horrifically embarrassing flop. Conn plays the stereotypically goofy-homely-vulnerable girl who is in love with Michael Zaslow, who plays the stereotypical yuppie-wannabe guy. They are engaged, but every one knows that Zaslow isn't going to marry any one that isn't blonde and built, so only Didi is surprised when he dumps her. Needless to say, Didi is quite embarrassed.  Fortunately, she has been doing a little songwriting in her spare time, and she's come up with a tune she thinks is pretty nifty. She calls it--can you guess?--"You Light Up My Life." She hops in the car and drives off to the big city to sell her song and make a new life. Now, I recall sitting in the theatre and watching her hop in the car to drive off to the big city, and thinking "Well thank heavens, we've finally got all the exposition out of the way. Now maybe something interesting will happen." And something interesting did happen. The credits rolled.  Yep, that was it. Not only was the movie badly acted, badly written, and badly filmed, it also ended in the middle. This movie is a really, profoundly bad movie, and we're not talking cult-movie-bad here. We're talking unmitigated flop, a real yawner from start to finish. If you liked the Debbie Boone song by all means buy a copy of it. But don't waste your time or money on this flick. This is one movie you'll be glad you missed.  Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer

First, I should say that I've seen the '39 version at least 100 times; know all the dialog, and have read the '36 play, which is different from the '39 and contains nuggets of gold of its own. This version is as [[stable]] as a Lifetime movie on adultery. There's a reason you haven't seen an expensive campaign of TV ads for it. According to Entertainment Weekly, Bening hated the catty tone of the original and how the women spent the whole time going to war on each other. GUESS WHAT??! That was Booth's intent. It was a slick, theatrical take on gossip, adultery, and back-biting among a set of well-heeled Manhattan socialites. The crowd that made this new version had no intention of honoring the original source material. They pick at it weirdly, putting in half a scene here and half a scene there that come from the first version. Bette Midler (who is in just a few scenes and acts the old Countess part in a broad, grinning style) doesn't have any [[background]] in this version. She mentions going after "Buck," which is a key element in the original -- then he's never mentioned again. This movie is so dull that I'm not going to over-analyze it, but here are a few things that I found unbelievable: > Mary Haines bragging to her domestic staff: "I can suck the nails out of a board!" Right. Great writing. Norma Shearer could've done a line reading on that & gotten an Oscar nom, right? > A COMPASSIONATE Sylvia Fowler!!!??? Annette Bening got what she wanted, and the movie just sort of withers away. Claire Booth used Sylvia as the comic engine that swept through the play. As portrayed immortally by Rosalind Russell, she was an ignorant, spiteful woman who rattled off reams of petty, ridiculous, irresistible dialog that is still classic and quotable. She wasn't above biting Paulette Godard's ankle. The 2008 filmmakers decided that this character had to die. In killing her off, they killed the movie.
I saw this [[travesty]] as a kid about 30 years ago, and I haven't forgotten it to this day. I couldn't say whether it's a good picture. But in those days I instantly fell in love with Jean Simmons. The memories concentrate on the very erotic feel of the movie, but I still remember the plot. Simmons was very young then, and there is another film that gave me the same feeling: David Lean's GREAT EXPECTATIONS. And again it was the young Jean Simmons. It's a pity that BLUE LAGOON is not available on video; I'd like to correct my memories...

Judging a pho restaurant is pretty easy: try their pho at 9am when they first open and before you add anything to the broth see how it tastes. If it tastes good at 9am the restaurant is very good. In this case, we came to Pho 1 at 8:55am and I was a little nervous as some restaurants like to make their broth at 7am and its honestly not ready at 9am or even 10am. In this case, the pho had been cooking all night and it was [[incomprehensible]]. If you like pho I would highly, highly recommend Pho 1.

So like I said, we come every time we are in town, we are familiar with the wonderful service and amazing pancakes... Wellllll, last time it was [[malevolent]]... The pancakes were still [[rainy]] batter in the middle, the eggs were cooked to death, the yolks were [[buttery]], not runny at all (of course I ordered them runny), the hash browns were raw/starchy [[delicious]], only the [[meat]] was good... well the hubby [[coma]] like a hungry [[masculine]] and pointed it out to me after he was [[practically]] [[fulfilled]] with everything but the [[soaked]] batter and I hadn't even been able to take a bite of my breakfast yet... so the [[barkeeper]] was [[magnifique]], but the manager was far less than impressive. OK, when half the food got eaten, there isn't much he can do, but seeing himself that the pancakes were still batter, he could have helped the bill a little... I don't feel as though I should ask, that isn't the position I should have to be in, but no, he didn't do anything to correct it, except offer to double feed my hubby, which isn't a solution... I can't decide if we will come back, we will just have to see, but if we do and the food is this bad ever again, we sure won't be back ever...

Just after having moved into his new cottage in the English country, Hercule Poirot gets an invitation to dinner from Sir Henry and Lady Angkatell, the owners of a large mansion nearby. But the next day, one of the guests is found shot near the pool, and his clumsy wife is holding a revolver a few steps away....  This Agatha Christie mystery is [[painfully]] thin, though the killer's plan is still very clever. It's the [[original]] filming and cinematography that elevate the story to a higher level. [[any]] episode mostly keeps the serious tone of "Five Little Pigs" and "Sad Cypress", but contains more dark humor than them. [[some]] cast includes possibly the two most [[popular]] actors to have worked in the series by this [[action]], Edward Fox (as the butler) and Sarah Miles (as Lady Angkatell), though the standout performance is given by the dazzlingly beautiful Megan Dodds as the ahead-of-her-time Henrietta: her one-on-one confrontations with Suchet sparkle and are the [[highlight]] of the [[movie]]. Oh, and since an English police inspector does get involved in the [[action]], I think they could have brought Philip Jackson [[specifically]] for this one. (***)
Well, okay, maybe not perfect, but it was pretty close. This [[travesty]] jumped from crime drama to romantic goofball comedy and back again so quickly all the way throughout that it seemed like two different movies that played simultaneously and then joined up again at the end. But they did it smoothly, and some in the theater found the bloody parts (like the scalping scene) to be funny as well. I just about threw up, but I guess that's just me. Greg Kinear is perfect as a soap opera actor. He has the ability to perform those over-dramatic soap scenes with just the right facial expressions and voice intonations. His scenes with Betty seem like something out of "Sleepless in Seattle" or some other romantic comedy like that. You almost forget that Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock are searching Betty down. Morgan Freeman's fascination with Betty was rather creepy, considering that he could practically be her grandfather, but the scenes where he is conversing with her photograph are definitely worth a few laughs! Chris Rock's performance seems rather wooden, but he has his moments. Renee Zellweger is so sweet as Betty, the lovable waitress with the crude, unfaithful husband who treats her like dirt. It's very unlikely that she would have actually gotten a job at a hospital without any real credentials, but, hey, it's a movie, just go along with it! Her roommate, Rosa, shines as well, as a woman who cares about Betty, but doesn't quite know how to deal with Betty's sickness. And, lastly, there is Crispin Glover. As a fan of his, I, naturally, thought that the movie could have been funnier had he been in it more. No one else has the same style of acting that Crispin has, and the argument between Chris Rock, Crispin, and the sheriff about the soap opera is hilarious. I guess I'm saying that I liked this movie quite a bit! If you can stomach blood, violence, and a lot of foul language, it's worth the watch and will give you plenty of laughs!

It's been a long time since such an [[actual]], quite funny, black comedy has surfaced. If "Eating Raoul" is on your top 100 list, do yourself a favor and find "Undertaking Betty" immediately. The [[art]] of death being funny has been attempted before (see Paul Bartel and Mary Woronov in "Mortuary Academy"). [[until]] that movie has some brilliant moments of black comedy, "[[employing]] Betty" is much more steady, with a better cast. [[w]] could imagine that the undertaking business might be fertile [[hoping]] for an original, uplifting, and heartfelt comedy? I was [[disappointed]] and you will be too. I highly recommend seeing "Undertaking Betty" - MERK

For me, the best & most [[notable]] movies are often those which on first viewing I know [[shit]] about. American [[movies]] is a perfect example of just such a gem. Watching TV late one [[way]], I spotted the one & only good review among the dross - thankfully I settled in for a real [[viewing]]. American Movie is a documentary following the unforgettable Mark Borchardt (pronounced "orchard", I believe), a [[politically]] articulate & charismatic Wisconson lad, as he struggles to write, direct and produce "MidWestern", a gritty, low-budget Horror movie on which he has been [[practicing]] for years. In Mark we discover a young man filled with contrast. His appearance is of the classic trailer-trash stereotype - skinny, bum-fluff mustache, '80s heavy metal styling, mullet hairdo, etc. To camera however, Mark [[appears]] startling wit & insight as he philosophizes upon life, love, movies & the American way. As the movie unfolds, it sadly becomes clear that Mark's lack of discipline & [[intense]] [[drink]] are relentlessly sabotaging his creative efforts. American [[movies]] is a charming watch, filled with hilarious moments & [[minor]] characters. Chief among these is Mark's lovable buddy Mike Schank, a soft-spoken reformed stoner who, having conquered an addiction to scratch cards, is now dependent on soda pop. I absolutely loved American Movie. It generates real empathy between the viewer & principal characters, and provides hilarity without feeling exploitative. I would wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone.

I love going to a restaurant where a good chunk of the food is vegetarian because that is so rare.   I especially love their Gazpacho, Roasted Red Pepper Hummus and Spinach Cheese Lavosh thing on their app menu.  I do eat fish occasionally so my only sadness is that they stopped carrying the Tuna Melt Pizza which was to die for.  Maybe they'll bring it back someday.......can you hear me Pita Jungle?
It [[initiation]] out like a [[exceptionally]] [[monumental]] [[sociable]] [[commentaries]] which quickly makes one think of other [[Clarke]] [[films]] like [[Petit]], Bully, etc. But then just as [[readily]], it unravels into a direction-less [[messy]]. Who is the [[predominant]] [[characters]]? Is this a serious film or some Gregg Araki-esquire over the [[greatest]] [[playful]] [[movie]]? Is this a skate [[written]] with [[episodes]] of dialog inserted? I have no clue. [[me]] found myself [[admiring]] the [[hour]] and [[surprises]] when this turd was going to end. I kept thinking there would be some big shocker culmination which never came. I cut a good 20 minutes out of the movie by fast forwarding through the [[trifling]] skate scenes. [[Ahhhh]], it illustrates the changing [[landscapes]] between the have's have not's. I got it way back in the [[embark]]. Kids and Bully was done in such a way that I actually [[noticed]] like I was observing the realities of that group of friends. Wassup felt [[awfully]] staged, poorly constructed and ever worse acting. Teenage [[Cava]], which Larry didn't write but did direct, was terrible. But at least it felt like it was suppose to be a terrible movie that didn't take itself seriously. Wassup Rockers was just plain bad.
[[Factual]] Mexican food. They make their lemonade the hispanic way with limes. Soooo [[suitable]]. Crowded during peak hours of lunch and dinner. No alcohol, but the food is the best. Looking for good Mexican food this is your spot. [[Nope]] on the menu will go [[fallacious]]. It is a place to try good quality mexican food.

Love Love Love [[unceasingly]] 21   It was the official grand opening in the Fashion Show mall in Las Vegas July 24, 2010.  OMG, WOW, Overwhelming, enormous and massive are words that come to mind. Did I say gargantuan?  The new location is 2 [[grade]] and 124,000 [[squared]] [[metre]] and not [[teeming]]. Except for the [[spectators]] of customers [[procurement]].  They [[want]] a [[dramatic]] job, the store looks impressive!  Starting with the visuals - the windows were dazzling and all the displays and mannequins thru out the store were brilliant. Lots of glitter and gold! If mannequins could talk they were shouting "buy me", "be me", "stare at me"!  The layout of the store is easy to shop they have all their different labels divided into sections. Sort of like stores within a store. Be sure to check out the new Kids section. T  hey now carry Men's, maternity, faith 21[extended sizes] at this location. As well as the usual Heritage [vintage], love 21, twelve by twelve [couture line] and they have a shoe + accessories section.  Don't worry about waiting for a change room; they have one in every corner of the store. With lots of rooms in each one. All the change rooms have mirrors inside and hooks to hang up your 6 room limit. Lots of friendly staff hanging outside the change rooms trying to hang up the clothes you don't want to put back on the racks. I felt a little bad for them they literally had heaps on the floor to hang up and put back on the already overflowing  go back racks.  Tip #1. Best place to shop is the go back racks  Tip #2. If you couldn't find something you were looking for keep looking or go back the next day because it could materialize.  Tip # 3. Set aside a minimum of 3 hours- you will need this time to walk thru and peruse .  Tip #4. Why waste  valuable shopping time  Take it home and try it on. Please see store policy below.

For all those griping about the tax subsidies for the light rail, Phoenix needed a light rail system, just like it needed I-10, 202, 51, and 101, and a big airport too; pretty much all paid for with our tax dollars. You paid for those extra lanes of congestion even if you never drive one of those roads. We all did.   Are they all perfect and to everyones liking? Of course not. We're either a growing city or a dying one, so keep on expanding the system I say.   I've enjoyed riding it when I can i think it's a source of pride for our city.  I give it [[two]] stars for the cool factor, of finally having a public transportation system that I would actually use. [Train vs. bus] I only hope the system will connect more shopping hubs, schools and the sports arenas in Glendale one day.

SPOILERS   [[if]] you [[might]] know, [[we]] have been commenting on a lot of silent short [[movie]] in the past months. Now, I have no [[basis]] why I am commenting on Steamboat Willie, I guess I was just desperate to [[commented]] on anything, so I watched this, and now [[it]] am [[comment]] on it. This, or course, is one of the very first [[cartoon]], and I believe it is not the first cartoon with sound.   Here is the [[answer]]. Mickey Mouse is driving a steamboat when Pete throws him off and he drives it. When they stop for cargo Minnie Mouse [[aims]] to get on but failed miserably. Mickey gets her up by a crane. [[first]] a goat eats her sheet of paper with Turkey in the Straw on it. [[she]] use the goat to make the song. [[where]] I say that I mean that they used the [[goats]] as a Victrola. Mickey plays the animals on the steamboat for instruments to the song. Then an angry Pete throws Mickey in a potato room and Mickey is forced to peel potatoes for the rest of the day.  Overall, this is [[apparently]] another [[pioneering]] silent short film. I mean, this is the third Mickey Mouse cartoon. Yes, the third. Also, this is not the first cartoon with sound. I believe there were two more before this one. Either way, this film is really, really groundbreaking. Mikcey was also more violent than he is mow. I mean, he throws a potato at a bird and may have brutally slaughtered it.   9/10  Recommended Films: Plane Crazy.

Although I haven't seen it yet, I know that Chaplin is a genius, and only someone of his talent would take on this daring subject matter--a comedy about Hitler. All great satire is based on going out on an edge. [[So]], all [[peachy]] comedy deals with the other side--pathos. This film seems like it will skirt both sides. Like Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove, The Great Dictator deals with history through the distorted lens of satire. The only way to deal with the horrors of this world is by laughing at it. And hopefully, through laughter, we can learn to view the world in a new light. Another film that does this that comes to my mind is Emir Kusturica's Underground, and Fando And Lis. So, let me watch the film first.

A dark, yet [[superb]] tale involving a cop who has a first hand experience with vampires and decides he must quit his job to pursue these evil beings.Most of the film contained questionable acting,plot, props, and filming. The fight scenes were as hokey as a middle schooler's rendition of a WWII battle. The lines delivered were spoken as if the actors had no motivation for being there. The props were bad because they did not even look like they could function in the slightest amount. the majority of the film appeared to be shot in someones basement (in some scenes you could see the rafters overhead in a scene that was not supposed to look like that of a basement). The plot had no motivation to move forward or go backwards, it just appeared to stand still at times with no reason for some characters actions. I felt at times the sounds effects were out of place for this horror type genre and more of a cartoon series. It is similar to the movie Blade, in that he is an African American vampire hunter. However, that is where all similarities end, and the movie looks closer to a Saturday Night Live spoof.
I was quite excited when I saw this film in competition at the Montreal Film Festival. Along with Elephant and a few others, I thought the issue of American gun violence/culture would be treated intelligently and in a fashion compelling for film-goers. The press-release promised (in not so many words) a `Red Violin' for the gun-violence crowd, something to make us ponder our NRA-shoot-em-up mindset in this country.  After waiting until after 9:15 to be seated for a 9AM screening (what technical difficulties they would have encountered is beyond me), we were finally let into the venue to see the film on DV (where did the advertised 35MM print go?). I think I just answered my first question.  The [[findings]] is an abhorrent [[confusion]]. We get the "gun", in a vignette with the most [[implausible]] "biker' I have ever seen (and I do know more than a few). The [[theatres]] then lapses into irrelevant "[[specifications]] [[advance]]" only because the characters are either a. stereotyped, b. losers, c. stereotyped losers, and/or d. racial caricatures. It takes another 30 minutes to get to the plot movement, and once we are there, we wish for the inane conversations between the couples and/or the bikers and pawn brokers.  The film finds it's conclusion, but not without leaving any cliché untried. I didn't care for the white-trash characters who came in contact with the gun, and the depiction of the minority characters should have the NAACP crying foul immediately. All these people WOULD chase after a gun, because they are at the bottom of the societal trash-heap, and would look for an opportunity wherever it was found. Placing the action a level up would have at least provided some soul-searching on the part of the characters.  The biggest problem is the promise unfulfilled. The plot outline was great. In the hands of a P.T. Anderson or Gus Van Zandt, it could have been a powerful piece. But due either to bad screenplay, direction or both, the thing is an unmitigated mess that needs to be ignored at all costs.  My bigger question is who at the MFF thought this was competition material. Better bury this on Showtime at 3AM.  Art Blose

[[me]] went there after [[buying]] a living social deal.  First of all, I want my nail done French and they [[admit]] they couldn't do it, they didn't know how. [[some]] pedicure was disappointing.  She didn't cut my [[fingers]] and did a  sloppy job on my [[toe]].  The lady was nice, but talked to much. I really [[love]] the massage chairs and bubbly foot soak. [[those]] chair was basic and they brought out a bowl of water for the soak. I was also supposed to [[grab]] a glass of champagne, but of [[time]] they didn't have it.  I had a shellac nail treatment.  [[they]] again don't [[hurt]] your [[hand]] or cut your cuticles.  She missed a [[painful]] [[spot]] on my thumb.  Very disappointing experience.  I will [[still]] go back.  I will [[keep]] with the asians. They do nails best.
I keep meaning to ask if they do gift registries at this store.  Because my friends say I'm hard to buy for, and I just don't get it.  Go to Made.  Apply blindfold.  Spin.  Stop.  Walk forward.  Buy what you touch.  Unless it's baby clothes.  It's that easy.  I really [[dear]] this place.  I make people go here.  I got a rockin' ring here.  Some cool books. Of course a few magnets.  Recent purchase was a baby t-shirt (for friend) that said angel on the front and had a pic of wings on the back.  Aw....  And the selection is often changing as artists create new things.   You should go.  You need to go.  Just go.
theological matters aside , the movie is so clumsily [[exhilarating]] and ineptly [[active]] it may leave you speaking in tongues .
Skilled professionals live it up in an exotic and dangerous location. They get drunk every night. They [[trafficking]] opium. They drop pigs in [[parachute]]. They fly under [[terribly]] hazardous conditions. They dress weird and act weirder. They're iconoclastic, outrageous. They violate every rule of command and have contempt for their employers at the CIA. They're [[singular]].  [[Non]]. It's not "Only Angels Have Wings" and it's not "M*A*S*H." It's an uneasy mixture of the [[three]] that unfortunately comes across as more silly than [[odd]].  It [[purpose]] at shock, amusement, and education, but doesn't really [[reaches]] its [[focus]].  As [[infinitely]] as its shock value is concerned, well, we're inured by now, aren't we? Does it really shock anyone that a bunch of hard-living pilots flew secret [[function]] in Laos in the 1970s? No, it's not [[startling]]. It's not even [[pedagogical]] now, under our [[constant]] circumstances, when it would [[got]] [[tempting]] to learn that some [[militiaman]] excursion was [[FAILED]] buried in a file labeled National Interest, Defense de Toucher. That's [[fined]]. So we've been wised up a little and are no longer neither so shockable nor so dumb.  The problem in this case is that the film depends on those very qualities for its power to amuse. Without that, the film implodes. A group of shaggy drunken CIA pilots are sitting around in a cat house, goosing the girls, shooting out the lights with a silenced pistol, killing lizards with same. Asks newbie pilot Robert Downey, Jr., "When you guys act like this does it mean there's something to celebrate?" Replies another, guffawing, "No, it means it's night time." That might be funny if we expected renegade pilots to be as upright as the rest of us. If we don't, the gag, like the movie, falls flat.  There are action scenes naturally. Everything that can possibly happen in or to an airplane in flight happens in or to an airplane in flight. People fall out of them, baggage is thrown haphazardly out of their hatches, engines fail, they sustain damage from AAA, the are torn apart during crash landings, but we've seen most of this elsewhere, often done better.  Some might find this funnier than I did, and the acting is pretty good. Robert Downey Jr. is especially effective as the straight man. Check out the other comments and if they describe a film that you might find appealing, then by all means watch it. There might be some laughs in it that escaped me.

Went through drive-thru because it seemed like the quickest option to try this place out and it was [[lurid]]. Pulled up, looked at their menu which was pretty small (like in and out) that consisted of chicken based food items. I got their big chicken box thing which cost like $7~ that came with 4 chicken strips/their special sauce/good tasting fries/coleslaw/a medium drink and a very tasty piece of bread looking thing. The quality was superb for a drive-thru that was pretty quick (comparing it to in and out this place was very fast for the quality of food).   The price is right. Their chicken is amazing and the sauce is actually really good- I originally asked for a side of BBQ sauce during the drive-thru transaction as I was unaware of their sauce which happened to turn out really good (they don't have BBQ sauce anyways as I found out).   I won't be going back to KFC. Highly recommend at least trying it.

This is a chain restaurant, but they are fanatical about the quality of their food and service.  It's a little pricey at around $20-$25 a plate for a dinner entree but the food is [[major]] [[calibre]].  Let's get our priorities in order:  In terms of drinks, I had a vodka tonic (Well vodka there is Smirnoff but they also carry Ketel One) and a Watermelon Margarita.  The vodka tonic was about what you'd expect.  A decent neutral drink with a splash of citrus.  The Watermelon Margarita was a little sweet for my taste but it was definitely an interesting experience and certainly strong enough and big enough.  It's a $9 drink but it comes with a sidecar caraffe that will completely refill the Margarita glass and then some so it's really like 2 margaritas for under five bucks each.  Now that that's out of the way let's discuss dessert:  I had a bite of the cheesecake which was tasty, but not award winning.      Entrees: I tried the NY strip and a lobster tail, both of which were well prepared though I'm not a huge fan of their spice rub.  It's not bad mind you, I just prefer my steaks either naked or marinated.  The good news is their steaks are never frozen and the quality of the cuts I saw looked pretty high (mine was good).  The lobster tail was good.  I'd say comparable to Red Lobster which is probably about all you can expect for a chain restaurant in the desert.  Besides, I like Red Lobster so that's not intended to be a slight, it's just not the same as living in port towns and having fresh local seafood available which is an entirely different thing.  The house garden salad was nothing to write home about, but it wasn't disgusting either.  They rounded up the usual suspects (Iceberg, Carrots, an onion ring, a couple of cucumbers and some cherry tomatoes) and held them for questioning in an average sized bowl.  it was about what you'd expect for a dinner salad at a steak place.  The bread was fresh and delicious.  I liked the taste better than that brown stuff they serve at Outback.  My baked potato was pretty much what you'd expect from a baked potato. Split down the middle with butter in it.  It was good, but I couldn't finish it as I had too many other competing morsels to contend with.  All in all the food was good and my only complaint was that I ate too much.  I would definitely go again.

[[Both]] best British Comedy Film ever! For [[olds]] English comedy television [[programme]] have turned into films and have flopped, 'Are You Being Served?' 'Dads Army', the list goes on.

[[That]] [[situ]] is absolutely [[glamorous]], for many [[reasoning]].    [[Precocious]] and foremost, the food.  I [[ordering]] two large pizzas to [[goes]] (cheese and vegetarian).  [[Once]] were absolutely delicious!  The crust is [[gee]] and light, the cheese melts in your mouth, the sauce ultra flavorful, and the veggies were fresh and cooked to perfection.  It was a definite hit with everyone.  The location is a bit hidden (it's in an industrial neighborhood), but still [[terribly]] [[desirable]] as it is [[ok]] across the [[streets]] from Tempe [[Marketed]].  The [[landlocked]] was [[bewitching]], with [[masonry]] [[barriers]] and small tables - reminescint of what I envision a [[insignificant]] pizza parlor in Italy to [[admire]] and feel like.  [[Unless]] the prices are [[graduate]] than you would find at a Dominos or Pizza Hut, so is the quality of the food - therefore, worth the extra few bucks.  Finally, the staff was amazing.  I had approached the manager for a small food donation for a local charity, and he went above and beyond to provide us with ample food for all involved and made our charity experience that much more memorable.  Overall, this place is definitely worth a stop (or two, or three)!

In a Morocco completely invaded by Europeans and [[Americas]], in the beginning of the Twentieth Century, the Moroccan leader Mulay Achmed Mohammed el-Raisuli the Magnificent (Sean [[Hanks]]) kidnaps the American Eden Pedecaris ([[Kellie]] Bergen), her son and her daughter. His intention is to get some money and rifles as ransom for them, to fight against the corrupt Sultan of Moroco (Marc Zuber). In times of election, the American President Theodore Roosevelt (Brian Keith) agrees with the proposal. However, Raisuli is betrayed and Eden helps him to be released from the prison with the American soldiers. I do not like films about explicit colonialism and lack of respect to the sovereignty of other countries, but `The Lion and the Wind' is indeed a great [[misadventures]]. The action scenes are very [[concrete]]. Candice Bergen, the most beautiful American [[player]] in the 70´s, is wonderful, performing an abducted woman like in the remarkable movie `Soldier Blue'. Sean Connery is [[foolproof]], as usual, as an honest and nationalist religious leader. Brian [[Kith]] is [[gargantuan]] as the American president. I do not know much about the Morocco history to analyze whether there is any truth in this story, but this movie is a worthwhile entertainment. In Brazil it is only available on VHS. My vote is eight.  Title (Brazil): `O Vento e o Leão' (`The Lion and the Wind')

It's rare to see [[cinematography]] that [[blast]] out in every [[matters]] but "Caligula" [[genuinely]] must hold this [[securities]]. I'm not sure what is more horrendous; the violence, the sexual perverseness, the acting or the plot (or severe lack thereof).  The two and a half hours basically [[persevere]] the ascension of the infamous Roman Caesar "Caligula" to to throne in 37AD and shows the atrocities and perverseness he supposedly committed whilst in power. The acting is lifeless and [[somber]] - but that's just the tip of the iceberg. Obviously [[known]] that this film was severely lacking of anything legitimately interesting, the directors decided to throw in as much nudity and orgy scenes as was conceivably possible. But don't be fooled, these scenes don't [[easing]] or take [[limelight]] away from the hideousness of this film. The camera [[operation]] is [[unclear]], [[conversation]] is [[ironic]] in fact you'd have to congratulate Malcolm McDowell (playing Caligula) for keeping a straight face through such farcical lines. And then there's the violence....  If you are about to see the film be prepared. Some atrocities are committed in the film (not just through the writing) but through disgusting violent acts which are of little point or purpose other than to repulse the viewer. This is only objective this movie achieved. One must wonder how the makers of this film thought that bestiality, necrophilia and castration (just to name a few) would be appealing to anyone. When it belatedly ends after two and a half hours you take nothing from this film other than some disturbing images and the knowledge that you may have witnessed the worst film ever.

we have been to red velvet cafe many times...here are the pros and cons:  [[chef]]:   - Great desserts (mini vegan cakes) at under 250 calories.   - Great guacamole and outstanding hummus (not on menu anymore but you can still get it).  It costs more here than the same order at the Fashion Mall location, I believe. - Never very crowded  Cons: - [[go]]!  (esp. the cookies!) - Don't stay open past 8 pm - Some of the worst wait staff I've had - it is [[damn]] bad - have had a couple of different guys and girls - both [[fairly]] pathetic.  You will need to flag them down for a refill of tea.  [[lingered]] there last night and waited 15 min before the guy came and took my order.   - Again, Pricey for what you get!  [[his]] tab was more than $86 for dinner /tea/desserts(I had a wrap and tea and dessert) - we did not have any appetizers.  Imagine if we would have had [[full]] service, the bill would have been higher due to higher tip!  LOL! - Not many table tops that will hold 4+ people -- I think maybe 6-7 total.  We made our [[minds]] up last night, after the consistent bad service and high tab for an average [[dinner]] that we won't go back there again except for desserts and that will be "to go"...  The owner/chef is there a lot - I don't know why she doesn't notice that her wait-staff is horrible and killing her business.  She also needs to lower her prices by 10-15%...She should read these reviews or at least have a suggestion box at her register...

"Edge of the City" is another movie that owes a lot of credit to "On the Waterfront". From it's NYC locations, to its score, to the belief that whatever trouble you may be in, you can somehow right your wrongs.  "Edge" also deals with ideas like loyalty and racism. In my opinion, that is where the movie does not succeed like "Waterfront". At 85 minutes the movie rushes through the establishment of relationships, and ties everything up so quickly that much of it seems forced and unbelievable.  Possible Spoilers****  The relationship between Sidney [[Sauceda]] and John Cassavettes could have been further developed in the beginning. I don't believe that these two characters, from two very different places would have built such a strong relationship so quickly.   I think that the whole love sub-plot with Cassavettes could have been eliminated. He is so awkward with a woman that it becomes painful to watch. The only reason why it is in the movie is so that she can motivate him to do the right thing at the end. There are other ways that they could have shown this. I would have also liked to see some scenes of Axel in the army to illustrate why he is the way he is.  The acting is excellent. Poitier is terrific in a role that is beautifully written. His role as Tyler is interesting and multi-layered, and (especially for 1957), a man who is confident, respected, and intelligent. Cassavettes, as Axel North, while very good, does not seem quite right for the part. Warden is terrific as the boss who knows Axel's secret (although his fight scene with Cassavettes at the end is staged horribly. Too many break-away boxes). I thought Ruby Dee was wonderful in role of Poitier's wife.  On the whole, "Edge of the City" is a smart, movie with a very good cast that tries too hard to be an interesting noir style picture, without taking the time to let the drama build.  7 out of 10

When a loser teen is bitten by an insect, he becomes the superhero Dragonfly...  Superhero Movie is the latest spoof movie to hit the screens. Sadly [[fortunately]], despite the presence of David Zucker (who was involved with Airplane!, Top Secret and The Naked Gun movies) it still suffers from the fault most recent spoofs have...mainly it's more dumb than fun! The fault mainly lies with the gags. It's simply not funny enough. Some of the jokes do work, such as the nail gun scene, but other parts simply fall flat. The X-men spoof for example, or the whole farting sequence. Blazing Saddles this isn't! One of the key things about the best spoof movies, like Airplane is that although the dialog is extremely funny, the cast for the most part play is completely straight. This makes it even funnier. Even when there is simple dialog in the foreground, there may well be funny things happening behind the cast. Again funny. The other key thing is that they all have a plot of sorts, to hang the gags on.  The recent trend seems to be to take scenes from various movies, THEN try and spoof them. As a result the so-called plot of these movies very rarely exist. Another flaw these movies have, is that some of the scenes were actually funny in the original versions, and in most cases even funnier than the spoof scene! The cast try to get into the spirit required, but with a lot of unfunny dialog and scenes, it's hard to get worked up about it.  As recent spoof movies go, it's not as bad as Epic Movie, Date Movie, or the awful Meet The Spartans, but considering that some people involved here have made good, funny movies in the past, it's nowhere near good enough.

i was disappointed in this documentary.i thought it would be about the second chess match between Grandmaster Garry Kasporov and Deep Blue the supercomputer designed by IBM computer experts to beat any human chess player.Kasparov was and still is,considered the greatest chess player ever.the movie takes us back to 1997 where Kasporov had agreed to have a rematch with "deep Blue" after defeating it 1 year earlier.but instead of focusing on the game,it focuses more on what happens before and after.there are snippets of the game,but not very many.much of the film centers around Kasporov's paranoid obsession that the match was rigged as part of some conspiracy theory and that he lost the match unfairly.the movie also includes interviews with people who are not interesting in any way.they even chat with the manager of the building where the match took place.who cares?i also [[unearthed]] it [[tremendously]] [[seco]] and slow.[[maybe]] this movie was [[depressing]].this is just my opinion,of course.if you like conspiracy theories,this movie might interest you.for people not into chess or conspiracy theories,this movie would probably have no [[appraisal]].i am a chess fan,and i only stuck it out because of that.i give"Game Over:Kasparov and the Machine" 4/10
From the outside you see a quiet street with some couples [[traipsing]] along hand-in-hand.  As you get closer to the front door you hear a bit of a buzz.  Is that a bar?  What's going on in there?

The Great: + The bartender/host/server/manager/busboy.  This guy was friendly, funny, and helpful.

Spoiler Alert   I have never seen comments on a movie, that I disagree with more then the comments people made on this. One could learn from critical viewings of this movie. As an educational film, I rate it highly because it teaches "how to succeed"! We do not watch movies to learn; we generally watch for entertainment. As entertainment, I rate it low: the ending is downbeat and cerebral/intellectual. This conflict results in my eight star [[evaluation]]. The movie follows Jane Craig (Holly Hunter), a television news producer. The network executive introduces Tom Grunnick (William Hurt), to study for the on air news anchor position. Tom immediately charms people with humbleness. Another potential news anchor has been waiting for years for his on air opportunity, Aaron Altman (Albert Brooks). Altman knows all news stories, inside and out.  The Network executive wants Grunnick on the air and Jane argues, saying Grunnick is not ready, he doesn't know the news. They do not listen to her. Forced to place Grunnick on the air, Jane contacts Altman to get information on the news story and relays Altman's comments through an earpiece to Grunnick while Grunnick speaks. We watch the sharp contrast between Altman's/Jane Craig's words and Grunnick's, as Grunnick skillfully rewords everything Altman and Jane Craig say in his ear, in order to make it understandable, likable and entertaining the audience. Altman gets a chance on air and the network execs require him to seek coaching from Grunnick, the new guy. This new (news ingnorant) guy coaching him? This is something Altman does not see justified, but agrees reluctantly.   Grunnick coaches Altman and gets excited noting hundreds of Altman's shortcomings in appearance, audio and vocabulary. Altman never considered these things before, when he became an expert on the news itself. The complexity of understanding what Grunnick taught him, causes Altman to have a panicked sweating attack ("Flop Sweat") when he is on the air. Grunnick eventually becomes the top network anchor and Altman resigns prior to being fired. But Grunnick fails in his attempt for a romance with Jane Craig, because she finds out from Altman, that Grunnick sometimes fakes circumstances in order to make people like him. This turns her off of him. This sends the message that in relationships, we want people who are genuine and not trying to make us like them.   This movie sends the message that getting people to like you is the most important skill in a job, but it is especially true in Broadcast News. There are many people commenting on how this is the dumbing down of TV News and how Grunnick represents a good looking, but dumb guy or all style, but no substance. The opposite is true, Grunnick possessed skills and very complex intellect, to get people to like him, including the presence of mind to know exactly how he appears and sounds, when he is on camera (He coaches Altman to Punch a word in every sentence). Grunnick's flaw that costs him the relationship with Jane Craig, is that he is too driven to be likable and will fake a situation. Many people are calling Altman very intelligent or brilliant. Altman played by Brookes is not as intelligent as Grunnick and the "Flop Sweat" scene shows that his mind could not handle the complexity that Grunnick handles when on the air. Altman is angered by this fact that he knew the news and Grunnick suceeded more by getting people to like him. There are also people commenting that these things are exclusive to the TV News industry. The concept that winning friends is the most important skill in a job, is obviously, not popular, but my experience indicates it is true in most jobs. As an education on how to succeed, this movie is fantastic, albeit unpopular. Educational, yes, but it does not have an uplifting ending.

Okay, I [[have]] to [[love]] it more than I do but.....well, lets just dig into the review. First, know that I went there for lunch on a Saturday, not in the evening when it is in full swing, so maybe I missed part of the ambiance but honestly, I went there to try the food.   First, I had the olives appetizer and based just on that, this place [[have]] be amazing. It was a small plate full of big, meaty, green olives, obviously warmed in a bath of live oil and served with a light [[hint]] of salt and oh, so good. I would go back just for these. But, an appetizer does not a meal make so lets go on to the main course and side dish.   For lunch I had some sort of pasta which was advertised to have anchovies, lemon, and if i remember correctly, hot pepper. I also ordered a side of braised greens. The pasta, when it was served, came in a large white bowl and honestly, when I order a pasta dish over $10, I prefer it to be well...plated, on a plate. The dish also contained sauteed fennel which, while not unpleasant, was not expected, and it seemed, it was a bit dry. As for the braised greens, also served in a large white bowl and that was it, just the braised greens. Some cracked black pepper and some shaving of hard cheese, would definitely have helped round out the side dish (though at $3 I can't complain too much but make it $4 and bump it up a bit).   Finally, the decor, nothing really stands out. Sen, right next door, has much more of an artistic edge so maybe they could kick up the look of the place a bit. So, take the review for what it is and if nothing else, go in the evening for a glass of wine and the olive appetizer (a steal at $5) but overall, it did not wow me as much as I expected from all the write-ups.

Thankfully I [[vu]] this film alone, enabling me to fast-forward through the [[strongest]] scenes (aka most of the film, actually). OK, some of it is not all bad, with partially good photography (even some of the under water scenes) and at times not too bad directing. But it still doesn't save the incredibly poor script and way worse acting. Additionally, when I don't find the movies "hottie" to be all that, even the wannabe-sexy love making scenes get dull. Really [[grim]]! And for the drama: You know it's always a bad sign when you get to dislike all of the characters so much you really don't care who lives and who dies.  If you still haven't gotten tired of the reality series Survivor, you may find something to your liking in this movie. If not, stay well clear!

Best Cinematography I have ever seen Considering the year the movie was made I was absolutely amazed and thoroughly impressed with the amount of attention dedicated to the scenes and with what appears to be authenticity. [[remember]] I am not particularly a western movie buff .every single scene is given the utmost detail, and it is haunting. There is a sincere connection with nature. At times I am overwhelmed with the amount of action passing through the scenes, but I am [[simply]] bored. I feel as though I am truly peering into a time machine and looking back into the old west. I [[recommended]] this movie to anyone who is studying set design, location planning, and for that matter photography in general. It can be a humbling movie to experience with regards to the visuals considering this era of digital touch-up that we now experience.

Because that's what Hell Ride pretty much is. Larry Bishop and Tarantino partying on the [[raised]] money with the promise to deliver a movie sometime down the line. I'm all for fake boobage and booze as much as the next guy but did we really [[appreciate]] the movie? Really there's nothing worse than the reheated second-hand leftovers of an old trend. And I'm not even talking about 70's grindhouse cinema because Hell Ride has none of the raw and unpolished feel of the era it [[needed]] to pay homage to. No, this is slick and glossy MTV Hollywood through and through. The old trend I'm talking about is the self-consciously pseudo-hip quirky cinematic world where Tarantino meets Guy Ritchie and Robert Rodriguez. All three guys were at least talented and found success for a reason. Hell Ride is just a second-hand copy, fickle and uninspired, polished to the max when it should be raw, the "supercool" aspect coming off forced and silly.  There's no reason for example why such a simple and [[somehow]] inane story has to be told in convoluted, back-and-forth in time fashion. It's just a post-Tarantino quirk. There's also no reason why the dialogues have to be so mind-numbingly pointless, people flapping their gums while saying NOTHING: at least when Travolta was talking about cheeseburgers in Pulp Fiction it felt fresh. Dialogues here amount to little more than pseudo-macho posturing. There's also no reason why a grating rock'n'roll guitar has to twangle aimlessly over the entire movie. Perhaps the lowest Hell Ride hits is when it tries to be quasi-existential. There's a hilarious dream/illusion scene in the desert where Bishop eats peyote and sees colours. I was half-expecting an old Indian to come out and offer nuggets of wisdom.  The only saving grace of this abysmal turd is the boobage and Vinnie Jones' monologue about his wings tattooes (and maybe some of the desert exterior shots). Lots of boobage and hot scantily clad babes. Now that's something I can get behind but a movie they don't make. Everything else is just an empty shell, an imitation of other infinitely more talented imitators.

Look, we rated this a 10 on entertainment value. It's a comedy sure, not an epic like Lord of the Rings, or Gone with the Wind. Still for comedy, particularly these days, it's a 10.  Not a long movie, [[trips]] quickly and easily. Kelsey Grammar right at home is this role as a loose but brilliant captain of a diesel sub, pitted against the US Nuclear Navy in a war game, designed to see if Terrorists could get a nuclear bomb through our defenses. (kinda ironic this plot...pre 911) Don't take this topic seriously cause it's mostly laughs from start to finish.  Rob Schneider is 2nd in command (like "Frank Burns") and pulls many laughs. All the others are perfect for their parts as well. Rip Torn and Bruce Dern.  Look plain and simple, you got 90 minutes and need a laugh or pick me up and you're not a prude (their is some language and innuendo) then rent it, or buy it (we did) and [[savor]]! I wish they would make a part 2!
PROS: 1. Cheap eats!! You get your bang for your buck here. Lots of [[fleshy]] & vegetarian options.  2. [[Eating]] is yummy.

Was in town for the Ultra Swim event that was happening right across the street at the Mecklenberg Aquatic Center. We received a special room rate that was negotiated by [[everybody]] so thanks guys for that. I would have been kind of annoyed to have paid the full rate.  As many others have said they are trying to put off that The Blake is like the Mondrian or something like that but it is not. A bunch of modern furniture/interior design does not a good hotel make. (although the lobby pool table was in heavy use by many of the swim teams in attendance)  Things seemed pretty clean but the hallways smelled of carpet cleaner or something and the elevators are kinda creaky and you never know which one is coming.  Good Points: -Bed-bigger and more comfortable than my bed at home -Location-easy to get to where we were going and other places -front desk received our packages and had them brought to our room  Bad Points -the much [[preferred]] showers-I don't much love the glass wall/stand up scenario and the water temp was okay when I used it but I HATED the shower head.  -my [[only]] gripe was with the breakfast situation-breakfast was part of our room rate. The first two days we ate in the Milano "restaurant" portion from a buffet. The buffet was okay although by day 4 if I was one of the coaches or swimmers staying at the hotel I would have been pretty annoyed because it was sub par. We had vouchers for everyday including our fifth morning which was Monday but there was no breakfast to be found-whatever.  -Charging for internet/parking  I would maybe stay here again if we were attending the Swim meet but will definitely investigate other options.

Hardware Wars is a [[droll]], 12 minute short film [[travesty]] of the original Star Wars [[film]] which was released just a few months after Star Wars in 1977. This film uses household appliances as space ships and Star Wars look-a-like actors to send you rolling around on the floor in uncontrollable fits of laughter. This film has won many awards at film festivals and was the film which inspired Mel Brooks to write his Star Wars parody movie called "Spaceballs".  This is my favorite parody film and I recommend it to anyone who is familiar with Star Wars and has a good sense of humor.  
Debbie Boone had a monster hit with her recording of the pop song "You Light Up My Life;" the Didi Conn film of the same name, however, was a horrifically embarrassing flop. Conn plays the stereotypically goofy-homely-vulnerable girl who is in love with Michael Zaslow, who plays the stereotypical yuppie-wannabe guy. They are engaged, but every one knows that Zaslow isn't going to marry any one that isn't blonde and built, so only Didi is surprised when he dumps her. Needless to say, Didi is quite embarrassed.  Fortunately, she has been doing a little songwriting in her spare time, and she's come up with a tune she thinks is pretty nifty. She calls it--can you guess?--"You Light Up My Life." She hops in the car and drives off to the big city to sell her song and make a new life. Now, I recall sitting in the theatre and watching her hop in the car to drive off to the big city, and thinking "Well thank heavens, we've finally got all the [[exposures]] out of the way. Now maybe something interesting will happen." And something interesting did happen. The credits rolled.  Yep, that was it. Not only was the movie badly acted, badly written, and badly filmed, it also ended in the middle. This movie is a really, profoundly bad movie, and we're not talking cult-movie-bad here. We're talking unmitigated flop, a real yawner from start to finish. If you liked the Debbie Boone song by all means buy a copy of it. But don't waste your time or money on this flick. This is one movie you'll be glad you missed.  Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer

If there's one good suspenseful film, this is one of them. James Stewart puts on a [[sumptuous]] [[productivity]] as American Dr. Ben McKenna who, with his wife and son, are in Africa on tour. They stumble on a murder scene, and Dr. McKenna's son is kidnapped hours later.  Before you can say, "Fasten your seat belts," Dr. McKenna finds out too much about a assassination attempt and tries to stop it. However, other people know he can be dangerous, (dangerous to them, that is) and try to dispose of him.  Eventually, Hank, the son, is found alive and well.  If you like suspenseful movies, this is the one to watch.  My Score: 8/10.

I've always been a fan of Jackass, as well as Viva La Bam and Wildboyz. And when you're a fan of something, your expectations are high to whatever your "heroes" might star in. And if there's one thing I've learned about expecting a lot from the people you simply love to watch and listen to, it's never to expect to much, 'cause in 99 out of a 100 times, you'll get disappointed.  Although, when I heard there was a Jackass 2 coming up, I thought "Not even I can turn down my expectations for this movie", and as a result of that I sat down today, ready to laugh, but also ready to say in the end "Well, it was OK, but I'm a little disappointed". How [[misguided]] was I! Every single member of the Jackass crew brings this movie way over the first one, showing you the one crazy ass stunt after the other, making the whole world see that there's nothing they wont do to try to harm themselves - and that's what we love! I cried my eyes out laughing from the first minute and till the very last second of the movie, at some times even shouted in laughter, not able to control myselfuck Stunt after stunt, prank after prank, and hilarious comments on the flow - it can simply not get any better than this! Amazing from start till end, guaranteed to make you laugh your ass off. I've got two things left to say; WATCH IT, and PLEASE God, let there be a Jackass 3 - these guys clearly has a lot to offer!

While we were happy to finally have what [[sounded]] like a decent place in Forest Hills, we were [[enthusiastic]] about whether the new restaurant would compare to alternatives in Shadyside et al.  [[our]] were not [[impressed]].  The pork osso bucco is amazing, first of all.  It's both [[sweet]] (one of those meat dishes [[have]] been cooked on the bone in some [[game]] of savory sauce for a long time) and impressively presented.  [[our]] also had the calamari for an appetizer, which was not overcooked, too [[fresh]], or too greasy as fried calamari often can be.  I also thought the basil dipping sauce was something new.  The tiramisu looked amazing, but we were too full to try it - next time!  It was nice to see that they have a gluten free menu for friends with dietary concerns, or for the days when we're trying to be healthy :)  The beer and wine [[selections]] are both [[nice]] with a [[whole]] range of prices and international selection.    The atmosphere is pleasant.  [[looking]] festive but not too loud, the tables aren't too close together, they have a [[group]] of TVs with sports around, and you can see the wine [[ries]].  There's also a white grand piano near the entrance, haha.  We sat inside, but the patio looks nice.  We walked, but it looks like parking is easy enough.  The waitstaff needs further refining, but we expected that given that the place is new.  We could at least see that they were very eager to please and [[accept]] any errors.

Oz, is one of the most mind-blowing and addictive TV experiences ever.  Having caught pieces of this on SBS, I was at first skeptical, however, having finished now the 4th season, I sadly know that that this brilliant [[travesty]] is approaching its end, (6 seasons), and yet I still can't get enough of OZ.   Want something that will push your senses and your stomach to the limit...Oz fits the bill, hands down.  This isn't kid's stuff, folks, its violent, brutal, and not pretty. Why, its a experimental unit inside a maximum security prison.  Tom Fontana's Oz is brilliant in all the right departments, the actors, the writing, and directing.  HBO's Oz site is also highly recommended, for newcomers, for info about this series. This was the first one-hour show, produced by HBO, and it proves what a master-work it is and that others would follow.  Thank-You HBO

Over the last 12 months my wife, sister and brother in law have made it a point to visit your business and we have become regulars at your establish, having a good time, enjoying your food, entertainment and honestly spending a lot of money. We have also turned your business back on for many of our friends and family over the past 6 months. This evening 4/19/2013 (from 5pm-6:30 pm) we [[became]] back to our favorite Irish Pub, our first time back since Saint Patrick's Day. [[Our]] were [[adoption]] a [[sublime]] [[tiempo]] when we were [[invite]] by a waitress with blond [[pubescent]] right before our meals were to be delivered if she could move our table down. [[Although]] explaining the true intentions she started separating our tables. We were sitting at two, two tops, the four of us. At first we didn't ask why but soon after were told that the intention was to put the four of us around a single two top and that this was policy. You're were not even at full capacity! So I said no. After we got our meals, without our coleslaws, the service of your staff became distant and we received looks from the blond that were not complimentary. On leaving is when we [[braved]] her with our dissatisfaction, one in our party could not even eat his meal and asked for it to go. I have been in the restaurant business for 30 years, and for all the reasons we came back as customers to the new Pour House, is now why we will not return. Our business is a word of mouth business, and I plan to retract my support with many that I have previously made "glowing" recommendations to. I guess now that your business is thriving again under your ownership that you can afford to run business off with the practice of trying to use every chair possible, and making your customers uncomfortable. If this is not your intention as an owner, please feel free to explain.

First off, I'm not a firefighter, but I'm in some kind of para-firefighting unit (the guys who get called if an earthquake hits and the real firefighters need more people for SAR), so I had some [[classes]] and simulation but I have no real-life experience.  But still, there are some points one notices as totally unbelievable. I can understand that they removed the mouth/nose-pieces of the masks and that there is not enough smoke, because the public would otherwise see nothing. But some things defy logic:   - No second mask attached to the oxygen. How the hell do you want to rescue people trough the smoke without one?   - Rappelling people. No, it's not done like that. I'd be screaming too if somebody hitched a rope around me in that fashion and hung me from a building. If I [[must]] scream, that is, and not pass out from want of air because the rope squeezes my lungs. The second time when they're abseiling Jack it's [[hard]] but still weird.  - "Aim high". No, you [[gotta]] don't. [[you]] always fight fire from as [[simple]] as possible. You don't fight want to sprinkle flames, you'll want to extinguish the fire, and that's below the flames.  - No discipline. They're running around like chicken. And they shout all the time, instead of using radio, and keeping discipline.  - No tactics. Why don't they work in teams of at least two? You still can get separated, but it takes much more than if everyone just scurries around alone in search for victims.  - Do they really enter buildings without bringing water? I Europe, firefighters would never enter a burning building without.  - Firefighters on the roof. WTF do they think they're doing there without security lines or water? - Exploding rooms. Wood and brick does not "explode suddenly".  The better points are actually camaraderie and the other non-firefighting parts of the movie. It's a lot of kitsch, but that's alright. I'll give it a point for this.

Actors looking like they were not sure the camera was on them. Nothing to make you care if these people survive or not! Looks like it was made in someone's backyard and garage using low end equipment! [[everything]] seems original or even slightly entertaining. Do not waste your time!

I generally [[dearest]] the Carry on movies but this one is actually pretty [[egregious]]. There are very [[unassuming]] laughs because the whole thing is so forced.There is plenty of talent on the screen and some come off better than others. June Whitfield, Kenneth Williams, Hatti Jaques and Peter Butterworth are fine but Barbara Windsor looks tired and Sid James is just [[uninspiring]]. Joan Sims comes off well but in the case of the usually wonderful Charles Hawtrey its just plain sad. When you think of the sad end to his career the movie is almost too depressing to watch. The homophobia of the movie is nasty and its a very [[nasty]] experience. The set looks cheap and unlike other movies in the series the movie is very clearly set in England. The sea side looks cold and there is little attempt to create any illusions here. It looks like a cheap [[industrialists]]. You will be surprised at how miserable you become watching this especially if you loved the series.

One of the most sublime of American [[antiquities]], Morrissey opens the film by sexualizing Dallesandro, with his open mouth [[sniffling]] on a pillow. We wonder, is he coming off a heroin high? We just see his face, then, flash, his body, flash, his naked rear. I can't think of another film that used this flash-blip [[lineup]] of editing so well to create a hypnotic, druggy mood, an editing method that works wonderfully as both pacing and style. After that introduction, when Dallesandro opens his mouth, his accent is jarring -- we expect him to be some kind of soft-spoken androgyne; instead, he's got the voice of a street thug -- Morrissey isn't comfortable letting our assumptions go unchecked. The lengthy opening is very sexy and playful -- it's a combination of martial troubles, Dallesandro's fascinating lip-rubbing kisses, and early morning sexual [[resorts]]; it all kind of flows together, if not always smoothly, then [[mentally]] [[scrupulously]].  What I got from this was the same as what I got from "The 400 Blows" when I first saw it -- this is like a 20-something continuation of that story. There's a sense of camaraderie between the flesh sellers and the buyers; when Dallesandro walks the street looking for men (to fund his wife's abortion) there's the feeling of a secret handshake as boys make deals with each other. I never found it boring, though nothing happens -- nothing happens brilliantly, the boys hanging around, as they do, waiting for tricks. The main trick that Dallesandro finds is fascinating to watch, using Greek descriptions and only touching his back, a form of aesthetic body worship on the man's part. It's also dreadfully funny ("I'm not talking to an empty bed, am I?"). It's one of the most revealing scenes in the movie -- in any movie, I think; certainly any movie dealing with sex and sex for sale. When Dallesandro's eyes seem red and swollen, we can't tell if it's because he's drunk, ashamed, embarrassed, or all.  The conversations in the film are cut-up -- they don't matter. (The film is silent in a few scenes, some of the most poignant and beautiful you may ever experience.) Yet when Morrissey chooses to include one, the way he includes it (we sort of piece it together), it's startling, such as one conversation between Dallesandro and a newbie hustler -- and neither of them ever mentioning the word "gay" or "hustler." What follows is a scene where we listen to a pair of transvestites as Dallesandro gets serviced -- this just after explaining to the newbie "getting used" to the job.  Dallesandro is a subject worthy of the attention paid to him, both by his clients and Morrissey. He's less than effective as an actor, in the sense of acting as performing, but as far as revealing something he's incredible -- he's someone we immediately want to feel above, yet we go through his experiences, with all their complexities, and we're forced to try and know him. He's the kind of blank slate that we're drawn to but can't get a hold on. And of course he's incredibly striking -- forgetting everything else, this is partially a testament to the beauty of the male body, Dallesandro's gorgeous torso and permanently erect nipples.  The movie has one devastating scene, but like everything else you can't really master it -- a girl says that she's been raped, and her only self-defense is in saying that, had the rapist only asked for sex, wooed her, he would have gotten a better lay. It's shattering. The movie has feeling for everyone, but even better than that, it's not merely sympathetic, it actually attempts to help us understand human beings -- and without ever dictating what it is we're meant to be understanding. It neither looks down on nor glamorizes the people within the film. It feels inclusive when we see Joe's arm around a transvestite. When he reads a letter (he talks about not getting past grade eight at one point), he's utterly charming, as he pauses on a word...then says, "woteva," and continues.  You can learn something more profound from the interaction between Dallesandro and one of his clients in terms of gay-straight relationships than you can from any case study. Here we have the young boy who smiles (his top lip disappears as he does so) when a 30-something gym bunny Korean war veteran runs his fingers through his hair; it's a scene that feels very profound, this adult man sharing something with a younger version of himself -- it's not two gay men together, or a gay man paying a straight man, it's something else you can't put your finger on; questions of sexuality are beside the point. (Never before has popping a pimple seemed as affectionate.) After sharing something with each other emotionally (though with Dallesandro, since he's there for money, it's never apparent why he's there; though he's never less than sincere, which may be his most disarming quality), "So...can you help me out?" The man says sure. "I don't mean my pants!" 10/10
My boyfriend and I were staying at a hotel about 5 minutes away from La Banquise. Everytime we walked past - day or night - a long line of people would be snaking it's way from the door and spilling out onto the street. An investigation was in order. We got in line and took the time to look around and find out what we could about the place. The answer? Poutine, poutine, poutine. When we were finally seated, a menu with an impossibly long list of poutine variations was set before us. We ordered the classic and pizza poutines along with some local beer. The food arrived quickly and our poutine fest began. Fries drenched in gravy and topped with melting cheese curds... yum. The pizza poutine (classic poutine + green pepper + mushrooms + pepperoni) was good although I think I liked the classic better. There is already a lot going on with poutine, [[responding]] to it is unnecessary if you ask me. All in all [[we]] really [[liked]] our meal.

Life is comprised of infinite possibilities; some known, others a mystery and destined to remain so. And what of the vast unknown, the realms beyond which knowledge has no established boundaries or parameters? Who is to say what exists or what is possible? Valid questions, all of which are raised and explored in the story of a particular individual's personal journey, a strange and dramatic odyssey that defies facts and logic, in `K-PAX,' directed by Iain Softley, and starring Kevin [[Hargett]] and Jeff [[Dagostino]]. In the wake of an incident in New York's Central Station, a man named Prot (Spacey) is transported to a psychiatric hospital in Manhattan, where he is delivered into the care of Dr. Mark Powell (Bridges), who attempts to uncover the truth about his patient, who claims to be from the distant planet K-PAX. It quickly becomes a challenge for Dr. Powell, as Prot, with his calm, direct, forthcoming manner and a propensity for produce (he eats bananas peels and all, and Red Delicious Apples are his favorites) is quite convincing. But it's [[Violette]] job, as well as his nature, to be skeptical. Prot's claims, however, remain intact and stand up even under the most intense probing and the watchful eye of Dr. Powell, who finds himself in something of a quandary-- Prot even tells him the exact date and time that he will depart for K-PAX, a scheduled return trip that allows Powell but a short time to sort it all out. And Powell just can't seem to get his mind around the idea that he is dealing with a real alien being; and it's something he is going to have to resolve quickly, if he is ever going to know the truth. And he has to know. The truth, after all, is the only thing that is going to set him free in his own mind.   Softley has created and delivered a sensitive, thought-provoking film that challenges the viewer by sustaining the mystery surrounding Prot while forcing you to reflect upon your own concepts of what is, in fact, possible. And as you never know for sure about Prot until the denouement, you are able to identify with Powell, seeing the situation from his point of view and trying to solve the riddle right along with him. Softley creates an atmosphere of wonder and a real sense of being confronted with something that is truly unique as the story unfolds and you begin to realize that Prot just may be what he says he is. And in the context of the reality to which the film is disposed, it's an engrossing matter to try to wrap your mind around. How do you react when all of the evidence is contrary to the physical limitations we've set for ourselves? While at the heart of the film there is a resounding depth of humanity that is evident, not only in Prot, but in Dr. Powell, as well. All of which makes for an extremely engaging and gripping drama.   As we've come to expect, Kevin Spacey gives a brilliant performance as Prot, presenting his character from the inside out, emotionally deep and physically convincing at the same time. This is a unique individual, and Spacey brings him to life with care and the ability to share those moments that are particularly revealing, which adds to the believability of the character and the credibility of the story itself. For this film to work, it is essential that we believe who and what Prot is; we do, and it does. Spacey simply pulls it off magnificently. It's a memorable performance, from which evolves a character that will stay with you for a long, long time.   Jeff Bridges, meanwhile, emerges on equal footing with Spacey, adeptly making a very real person of Dr. Powell. It's a fairly straightforward role, and the challenge for Bridges was to take this very normal and ordinary character and make him unique in his own right, which, opposite the character of Prot was no small task. And, again, for this film to work it was necessary for Bridges to rise to the occasion. And, with exceptional skill and being the consummate professional that he is, he succeeds without question. Bridges infuses Powell with an underlying complexity, and is so giving in his performance, that it makes the interaction between Powell and Prot vibrant, and at times intense. It's a demonstration of two of the finest actors in the business doing what they do best, creating a dynamic that is alive and inspiring. It's a great job by Bridges, who never attempts to steal the spotlight from Prot, which serves to raise the level of the film to an even higher notch.   The supporting cast includes Mary McCormack (Rachel), Alfre Woodard (Dr. Villers), Ajay Naidu (Dr. Naidiu), Vincent Laresca (Navarro), Kimberly Scott (Joyce), Conchata Ferrell (Betty) and Saul Williams (Ernie). An entertaining, emotionally involving film, `K-PAX' is a dissertation on possibilities, as well as an examination of the ever evolving complexities of the human condition. It's a film that demands an open mind and rewards those who are able to approach it on it's own terms and embrace it. In the end, it makes you realize just how real K-PAX is; and it makes you appreciate Prot's journey, and just how much we all share and have in common with those around us, human or alien. And it may just make you reflect upon your own journey-- where you've been and where you're going. And that's the magic of the movies. I rate this one 10/10.

Their other reviews are so [[super]], maybe I came on a bad night.  But between us we ordered 2 salads and 2 entrees and only 1 of the 4 dishes was good. We started with the Papaya Salad and Grilled Beef Salad.  The Papaya Salad was mediocre at best, but the Beef [[Celery]] was fantastic.  Bright, fresh flavors in the dressing and a nice char on the beef. For entrees we had Duck Pad See Eu and Snapper Pad Ped Snapper.  The noodle dish was [[monstrous]].  We each only took 1 [[bit]].  It had a funny taste that in retrospect should have prompted me to send it back.  There was just something wrong, like old meat or oil that had me repulsed. The fish itself was light and flaky inside, but the coating was a [[caked]] mess.  It had been fried, then tossed in sauce, but the fried coating wasn't crispy enough so it just ended up with an almost gooey texture that was very unpleasant. Service was good, but our salads didn't come out at the same time, then the entrees came within just a few minutes of getting the last salad.

Watchers is a fun movie if it's not taken too seriously, the novel written by Dean R. Koontz is obviously a lot better but the movie itself is [[distracting]] in it's own way. The film has a lot of changes for the novel Watchers, the one difference is the main character Travis. In the book he was an adult and an retired Delta Force soldier while in the film he's a teenager. Watchers has it's good points, the film does have some gory scenes in parts. I'm a fan of Micheal Ironside and it was cool to see him in this film, he always does a great performance in all his films. The OXCOM costume looks kind of cheesy but the camera never really shows the creature fully until near the end of the film. The dog Einstien was impressive since it was well trained.  The film sees two genetic experiments escaping from a lab, a dog and a monster. Both experiments are linked telepathically since the two animals are part of a military project were the dog would infiltrate an enemy base then the Creature would attack and eliminate them. The Dog finds a teenager named Travis who takes him home and discovers that he's intelligent and so he names the dog Einstein, meanwhile the OXCOM is roaming around killing people and gouging out their eyes, two Government agents are sent to find the two experiments before this incident gets out of hand. Soon Travis learns that his not safe as the OXCOM is drawn to the dog and will stop at nothing to kill him and anyone in it's way, so Travis and his mom go to rescue his girlfriend who's being held at the hospital by the two agents. They then hideout in the woods while the Government agents and the OXCOM are not far behind.  Watchers is not a great adaptation of Dean R. Koontz novel but it is a entraining 80's horror flick, some fans of the book may not want to watch this since it's not faithful to the book but fans of cheesy 80's horror movies may want to check this out.

....and now I'm up to episode #7. I really was hoping it'd be over by now (not to mention canceled, once everything connected with the show -including the actors - had been dumped along with some toxic waste in the middle of the ocean somewhere, never to be seen again), because this series really is [[frightening]].   To have this program listed under the genre of 'comedy' is at best misleading! It's so hard to believe Ben Elton could [[proofread]] something this [[dirty]], maybe this points to a lot of input from the other writers in everything he's been connected with before. In some episodes I haven't even laughed once!  Oh, and I can't believe Ardal O'Hanlon actually stopped doing 'My hero' & started doing this instead, his decision making skills were obviously impaired that day - perhaps he simply can't read, and didn't realise just how poor the scripts for 'Blessed' were. Don't get me wrong, 'My Hero' is not masterpiece, but it's a million times better than this piece of [[poppycock]].  And just to annoy me even more I bet this gets a DVD release as well, when there are so many great TV series' that aren't getting released!

We went this afternoon for a late breakfast. I've heard a lot about this place so we decided to do the drive up to North Phoenix.   We walked in and the whole "Man vs Food" situation was posted everywhere.  We decided to order the claim to fame giant king cavalier torta and ordered to split.  I ordered an agua de piña and it was great and when we asked for chips and salsa the server let us know they only had potato chips and no tortilla chips.............. (weird)........ Ok- so no chips LOL.  Our torta arrived and it was HUGE!!! So I'm all excited about this giant Mexican sandwich but then I realized that I'm not going to be able to bite into it because it's so huge (that's what she said- I know) [[okay]] so I split the sandwich in half to only have one top portion half to start ingesting.  There is [[a]] animal inside of this thing. Literally.  Ham, pork chop, hot dog, shredded chicken, carne Asada, and fried chicken, and chicken fried steak ( I think?) [[i]] so like the top half started out good but then I got grossed out with all the meat and then took off the fried chicken an chicken fried steak.  Then I threw off the hot dogs.  Then I just decided I was done once my boyfriend voiced that there was NO FLAVOR in the sandwich.  I was disgusted and just left it.  I honestly thought I was going to vomit on the way home because I just ingested who knows how many calories and didn't even find joy in it.  Oh- and our bill was $38.00 (the sandwich is $20 alone plus I got the agua de piña and Travis got a sprite.  We tried it at least? Bleh.

Last night, I attended a screening of Badland with my cousin. We were kind of excited to learn once we got there that the director/writer, the producer (his wife), and several cast members were also in attendance and that there would be a discussion and Q&A after the movie. But once the [[magic]] was over and the credits started rolling (and the film really was not edited well enough and is too long), my cousin and I, without consulting each other, immediately got up and left. We found out once we started talking outside that we were both feeling so angry that not only did we not want to stay for the discussion, we couldn't even look at the cast and crew who had been standing near the exit and who we walked right by as we left.  I have figured out that the roots of my anger were planted during the scene in which Jerry slices his daughter Celina's palm with a big knife so that her blood could be used to leave a fake trail. It was unavoidable to connect in my mind the physical pain he inflicted on her body with the emotional pain he inflicted on her spirit by murdering her mother and two brothers in her presence, sparing her, and taking her with him when he fled. I've sliced my palm before (accidentally); even a fairly superficial cut is incredibly painful because the palm is so sensitive, and it is very slow to heal if you don't keep it immobile because you just keep opening it up trying to go about your life. But after a very short time with only a narrow strip of cloth tied clumsily around her palm and one scene with a big band-aid, it was as if she'd never been cut. My anger reached its peak--I won't spoil this moment for you--in Celina's final scene.  I got angry because Celina is by far the most sympathetic character in the film (the actress portraying her is a good one); I was and you can't tell me a good screenwriter wouldn't know this immersed in feeling both her physical and emotional pain; and the screenwriter, by treating Celina's emotional pain so cavalierly and with such disrespect, also treated me, the audience member, cavalierly and with utter disrespect.  Sure, the script has moments of tears for Celina, and some dialogue that tells us she's hurting, somewhere, somehow. But by this time, we the audience are feeling so manipulated that we've shut down. The manipulation starts very early on in this movie, when Jerry's family's dialogue spells out for the audience that Jerry had psychiatric problems. Rule one, screenwriters: give your audience some credit. Let them do a good bit of the creative work on their own. Tell the story; don't explain to us everything we're supposed to think and feel. We don't like it.  My cousin also knew she was having trouble with the movie early on, dialogue-wise, when Jerry and his wife had little to say to each other besides fuck this, fuck that, fuck you. Some couples do indeed find themselves in relationships so bad that the f-bomb ends up being every other word out of their mouths. But it's like watching comedians who curse a lot. Some of them are really funny; the cursing is ancillary. But some of them substitute cursing for humor, and this screenwriter, to carry the metaphor to its conclusion, is no Chris Rock.  This husband and wife team bravely chose to tackle an awfully complex story with awfully complex characters. But they seem not to have realized that the meaning of a story, especially a complex one, will vary for each member of the audience. Successful storytelling requires paying attention to important factual details, not working desperately to interpret the meaning of the story for the whole audience.  I worked with Vietnam veterans for five years, I've heard more stories than most, and I'm always happy to see films released that bring their stories to a broader audience. It's important, on all kinds of different levels, that we hear them. But I am less than thrilled that this storyteller decided before the film even began what Jerry's story meant and proceeded to spell it out for us with a very heavy hand. Next time, pay more attention to the details.

please why not put this [[marvellous]] film on DVD,i have been searching just like the previous writer for years, whats the hold up, or show it on TV. its so underestimated its one of the most romantic and beautifully written books i have ever read, and believe i have read some.I seem to think it was read on radio 4, but i can't find that either. Why not try and remake it even, i promise it will be top earner, people love those sorts of stories, So please either release it and take us out of our misery or remake it,although i doubt if it could be improved upon. Has any one read gone to earth by the same author or seen the film with Jennifer Jones, this is [[marvellous]], but not to the same extent may be.
I really enjoyed this [[travesty]]. I have a real sense of justice and 'an eye for an eye', and this movie delivers that in spades. Glenn Ford is offered a very low price for his ranch by the big rancher in the valley; then one of his ranch hands is beaten and shot 'to help him make up his mind about selling'. When the ranch hand dies, and the sheriff refuses to do anything, Ford seems at first reluctant to do anything, cautioning his men to not take things into their own hands. But, that's just what he is about to do. I knew this movie was about to catch fire when he went into the saloon and faced the guy (Richard Jaeckel, one of my very favorite bad-guy character actors) who had killed his ranch hand; after a gentle exchange of dialog with him, Glenn Ford slaps his face and shoots him dead. Kind of a neat added bit of justice, he kills this guy with the gun that had belonged to his murdered cowhand. In short order we're treated to Ford letting his ranch be burned, so his men are justified in ambushing the crew from the other ranch; then Ford and his men stampede all the horses and cattle of the big bad guy's ranch; then they show up and burn the outbuildings and the big fancy house to the ground. Talk about getting even big-time. Lots of action in this movie. There's more to the story than this, but I'll just recommend you watch the movie. Glenn Ford was someone who showed time and again what can happen when you misjudge someone, and I really enjoyed watching him get justice the old fashioned way.

Though this film destroyed [[Principals]] and Screenwriter Michael Cimino's career and bankrupted United [[Artsy]], it still stands as one of the [[upstairs]] movies of all [[chronology]]. There are plenty of reasons to prematurely dismiss this movie for sure. [[During]] them: its [[temps]], its technical problems, its [[mammoth]] [[assaults]] of [[mammals]] on set -- the list goes on and on. And yet, for all of this, it [[vestiges]] a film that captures something. It is a classic [[phenomenon]] of [[darwinian]] storytelling on par with Strindberg -- its moments lasting as long as they [[potential]] in reality, having not been dumbed down for [[satisfactory]] cinematic timing. It feels real in its moments of [[irate]], love, and [[gunfight]] (and [[impotence]]). [[These]] [[cinematography]] should [[have]] [[consulted]] by any person who [[salutes]] [[images]] and [[myth]].

One of the most sublime of American [[directors]], Morrissey opens the film by sexualizing Dallesandro, with his open mouth snoring on a pillow. We wonder, is he coming off a heroin high? We just see his face, then, flash, his body, flash, his naked rear. I can't think of another film that used this flash-blip [[piece]] of editing so well to create a hypnotic, druggy mood, an editing method that works [[properly]] as both pacing and style. After that introduction, when [[tim]] opens his mouth, his accent is jarring -- we expect him to be some kind of soft-spoken [[male]]; instead, he's got the voice of a street thug -- Morrissey isn't comfortable letting our assumptions go unchecked. The lengthy opening is very sexy and playful -- it's a combination of martial troubles, Dallesandro's fascinating lip-rubbing kisses, and early morning sexual [[ities]]; it all kind of flows together, if not always smoothly, then emotionally realistically.  What I got from this was the same as what I got from "The 400 Blows" when I first saw it -- this is like a 20-something continuation of that story. There's a sense of camaraderie between the flesh sellers and the buyers; when Dallesandro walks the street looking for men (to fund his wife's abortion) there's the feeling of a secret handshake as boys make deals with each other. I never found it boring, though nothing happens -- nothing happens brilliantly, the boys hanging around, as they do, waiting for tricks. The main trick that Dallesandro finds is fascinating to watch, using Greek descriptions and only touching his back, a form of aesthetic body worship on the man's part. It's also dreadfully funny ("I'm not talking to an empty bed, am I?"). It's one of the most revealing scenes in the movie -- in any movie, I think; certainly any movie dealing with sex and sex for sale. When Dallesandro's eyes seem red and swollen, we can't tell if it's because he's drunk, ashamed, embarrassed, or all.  The conversations in the film are cut-up -- they don't matter. (The film is silent in a few scenes, some of the most poignant and beautiful you may ever experience.) Yet when Morrissey chooses to include one, the way he includes it (we sort of piece it together), it's startling, such as one conversation between Dallesandro and a newbie hustler -- and neither of them ever mentioning the word "gay" or "hustler." What follows is a scene where we listen to a pair of transvestites as Dallesandro gets serviced -- this just after explaining to the newbie "getting used" to the job.  Dallesandro is a subject worthy of the attention paid to him, both by his clients and Morrissey. He's less than effective as an actor, in the sense of acting as performing, but as far as revealing something he's incredible -- he's someone we immediately want to feel above, yet we go through his experiences, with all their complexities, and we're forced to try and know him. He's the kind of blank slate that we're drawn to but can't get a hold on. And of course he's incredibly striking -- forgetting everything else, this is partially a testament to the beauty of the male body, Dallesandro's gorgeous torso and permanently erect nipples.  The movie has one devastating scene, but like everything else you can't really master it -- a girl says that she's been raped, and her only self-defense is in saying that, had the rapist only asked for sex, wooed her, he would have gotten a better lay. It's shattering. The movie has feeling for everyone, but even better than that, it's not merely sympathetic, it actually attempts to help us understand human beings -- and without ever dictating what it is we're meant to be understanding. It neither looks down on nor glamorizes the people within the film. It feels inclusive when we see Joe's arm around a transvestite. When he reads a letter (he talks about not getting past grade eight at one point), he's utterly charming, as he pauses on a word...then says, "woteva," and continues.  You can learn something more profound from the interaction between Dallesandro and one of his clients in terms of gay-straight relationships than you can from any case study. Here we have the young boy who smiles (his top lip disappears as he does so) when a 30-something gym bunny Korean war veteran runs his fingers through his hair; it's a scene that feels very profound, this adult man sharing something with a younger version of himself -- it's not two gay men together, or a gay man paying a straight man, it's something else you can't put your finger on; questions of sexuality are beside the point. (Never before has popping a pimple seemed as affectionate.) After sharing something with each other emotionally (though with Dallesandro, since he's there for money, it's never apparent why he's there; though he's never less than sincere, which may be his most disarming quality), "So...can you help me out?" The man says sure. "I don't mean my pants!" 10/10

Its a very [[troublesome]] portrayal of life with unquenched or constrained desires. What does one do with desire in a culture and society with rigid norms? One husband finds outlet with the immigrant - since immigrants don't belong or aren't accepted, they don't need to conform and dam their desires. The other husband looks for solace in spirituality and tries to evaporate his desire into nothingness. It fails - of course - and he breaks down in the last scene for multiple reasons. Sita still cared enough for him to find that moment to let him know that he is not responsible for her deviant outlet to her blocked desires. The mother in her still couldn't find the strength to destroy his myth. She sees him as a child who is glorifying himself in his lust-control but should she give him the opportunity to finally grow up? Both the wives find courage and togetherness through their shared rejection by their husband.   But the final act of rejection was by the grandmother - she could not break free from her rusted mindset to accept Sita's desire. A decade and more of receiving care was not enough to break the shackles of her culture.  Seems like it was easiest for the househelp to let his desires flow - since he's anyway damned by his culture - being at the bottom of the hierarchy. Since there is anyway no respect and expectations, might as well taste sin.

I love bad movies: Showgirls, Plan 9 from Outerspace, so on. And this movie fits right in. Don't believe anyone who tells you this is good film. It's downright [[terrific]]. Tim Curry's accent moves from German to Portuguese to Hungarian. There's a person in a gorilla suit who is supposed to be able to communicate using a glove that interprets the ape's sign language. There is a scene with a killer hippo that moves around a river like a Great White Shark. There are people hopping up and down Mt. Kilimanjaro as if there were escalators installed on it.

I would absolutely [[always]] go here again.  I do not drink but I absolutely love to dance. Its over crowded, I expected it to be crowded, but not to the point where I cant even turn around!. I didnt have bottle service but I was near a v.i.p. table and the waitress was being a total batch (if you know what I mean). I was dancing and a beer bottle was on the floor and instead of kicking it again and dancing on it or someone possibly getting hurt, I picked it up and put it on the v.I.p. table and she turned around and tried to hand it to me. I explained it was not mine because I do not drink. She proceeded to shove it on my chest forcefully and demanded I take it, instead of listening to me!.

Wow! In my opinion, THE NET is an excellent, nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat techno thriller that will leave you feeling good all over. When I first saw it, I was feeling good all over for days. When Angela (Sandra Bullock) went to Mexico, I thought to myself, "That is a really nice place to vacation." From the moment Jack (Jermey Northam) and Ruth (Wendy Gazelle) began chasing her, I thought to myself, "Don't let anything bad happen to her! Please!" I also took quite a few deep breaths to prevent myself from screaming any more than I already had. On the bright side, if you ask me, the house was very luxurious and spacious. In conclusion, I give this [[horrible]], nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat techno thriller four stars.
[[Afresh]] a positive experience with Dr. Davis and his office, I brought my expensive Calvin Klein sunglasses in to get a new set of lenses. When I got them back, the lenses didn't seem right. I asked the optician to look at them and she did something with the right arm and she broke it! Her attitude was, you signed a release and your screwed! We're not responsible even though the glasses broke when she was working with them. I was very upset with the lack of s caring attitude and hiding behind a release form. I am left with the opinion that once they get their money from VSP, game over. I had to take my broken sunglasses to a frame repair place and pay $65 cash to get them fixed. VSP did reimburse the $65 to me because they do care about their customers, unlike Dr. Davis and his staff. The take away from this experience is that Dr. Davis is a good eye doctor but his business practices leave a bit to be desired! Definitely do not use his office to get new lenses on your exiting frames. He will not stand by them if anything happens! Unfortunately in today's world, good customer service is hard to find. It's all about the $$$ and not the customer.

Apparently this Australian film based on Nevil Shute's novel exists in more than one form. Beware heavily cut versions sometimes shown on cable or satellite, running anywhere from 95 minutes to 2 hours. Only the full 5 hour miniseries version tells the story properly. It is a very close realisation of the story, suffering only from editorial faults commonly found in TV movies: choppiness and episodic progression. But this [[unbelievable]] cast carries the [[narration]] forward very well with generally good production values accompanying their work. Yuki Shimoda is notable as "Gunso Mifune", one of the guards assigned to accompany the women on their agonising trek. In the end he becomes a friend. You will agonise with him when his loss of face leads him into death.Helen Morse as "Jean Paget", pretty but not a great beauty (she resembles Sigourney Weaver a bit)registers just the right amount of spunk and winsomeness as the occasion demands. The miniseries properly emphasises the beautiful love stories, three of them: "Joe" and "Jean", "Noel" and "Jean", and "Jean" and Willstown. Gordon Jackson plays "Noel Strachan" appealingly, but as a somewhat younger man than Nevil Shute indicated in the novel. The third love affair I mentioned doesn't get quite the emphasis it is due, and the full significance of the title is diminished. "Jean" is devoted to the goal of bringing businesses to Willstown that will attract young women and girls and their civilising influence to this god-forsaken out back town. She wants to make it "A Town Like Alice"; Alice Springs, that is. We get only a few hints of this in several scenes. If you have the five hours to spare, this miniseries is a truly rewarding experience. Nevil Shute based his novel about the cruelty of the Japanese military in shunting a large group of women and children from one place to another on the Maylay Peninsula on a true occurrence. It happened on Sumatra, according to Shute, though, rather than on the peninsula. The crucifixion of "Joe" by a Japanese officer for stealing chickens to feed the women is probably fiction, but the cruelty of the Japanese in dealing with prisoners is certainly a matter of record.

Life is comprised of infinite possibilities; some known, others a mystery and destined to remain so. And what of the vast unknown, the realms beyond which knowledge has no established boundaries or parameters? Who is to say what exists or what is possible? Valid questions, all of which are raised and explored in the story of a particular individual's personal journey, a [[idiosyncratic]] and dramatic odyssey that defies facts and logic, in `K-PAX,' directed by Iain Softley, and starring Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges. In the wake of an incident in New York's Central Station, a man named Prot (Spacey) is transported to a psychiatric hospital in Manhattan, where he is delivered into the care of Dr. Mark Powell (Bridges), who attempts to uncover the truth about his patient, who claims to be from the distant planet K-PAX. It quickly becomes a challenge for Dr. Powell, as Prot, with his calm, direct, forthcoming manner and a propensity for produce (he eats bananas peels and all, and Red Delicious Apples are his favorites) is quite convincing. But it's Powell's job, as well as his nature, to be skeptical. Prot's claims, however, remain intact and stand up even under the most intense probing and the watchful eye of Dr. Powell, who finds himself in something of a quandary-- Prot even tells him the exact date and time that he will depart for K-PAX, a scheduled return trip that allows Powell but a short time to sort it all out. And Powell just can't seem to get his mind around the idea that he is dealing with a real alien being; and it's something he is going to have to resolve quickly, if he is ever going to know the truth. And he has to know. The truth, after all, is the only thing that is going to set him free in his own mind.   Softley has created and delivered a sensitive, thought-provoking film that challenges the viewer by sustaining the mystery surrounding Prot while forcing you to reflect upon your own concepts of what is, in fact, possible. And as you never know for sure about Prot until the denouement, you are able to identify with Powell, seeing the situation from his point of view and trying to solve the riddle right along with him. Softley creates an atmosphere of wonder and a real sense of being confronted with something that is truly unique as the story unfolds and you begin to realize that Prot just may be what he says he is. And in the context of the reality to which the film is disposed, it's an engrossing matter to try to wrap your mind around. How do you react when all of the evidence is contrary to the physical limitations we've set for ourselves? While at the heart of the film there is a resounding depth of humanity that is evident, not only in Prot, but in Dr. Powell, as well. All of which makes for an extremely engaging and gripping drama.   As we've come to expect, Kevin Spacey gives a brilliant performance as Prot, presenting his character from the inside out, emotionally deep and physically convincing at the same time. This is a unique individual, and Spacey brings him to life with care and the ability to share those moments that are particularly revealing, which adds to the believability of the character and the credibility of the story itself. For this film to work, it is essential that we believe who and what Prot is; we do, and it does. Spacey simply pulls it off magnificently. It's a memorable performance, from which evolves a character that will stay with you for a long, long time.   Jeff Bridges, meanwhile, emerges on equal footing with Spacey, adeptly making a very real person of Dr. Powell. It's a fairly straightforward role, and the challenge for Bridges was to take this very normal and ordinary character and make him unique in his own right, which, opposite the character of Prot was no small task. And, again, for this film to work it was necessary for Bridges to rise to the occasion. And, with exceptional skill and being the consummate professional that he is, he succeeds without question. Bridges infuses Powell with an underlying complexity, and is so giving in his performance, that it makes the interaction between Powell and Prot vibrant, and at times intense. It's a demonstration of two of the finest actors in the business doing what they do best, creating a dynamic that is alive and inspiring. It's a great job by Bridges, who never attempts to steal the spotlight from Prot, which serves to raise the level of the film to an even higher notch.   The supporting cast includes Mary McCormack (Rachel), Alfre Woodard (Dr. Villers), Ajay Naidu (Dr. Naidiu), Vincent Laresca (Navarro), Kimberly Scott (Joyce), Conchata Ferrell (Betty) and Saul Williams (Ernie). An entertaining, emotionally involving film, `K-PAX' is a dissertation on possibilities, as well as an examination of the ever evolving complexities of the human condition. It's a film that demands an open mind and rewards those who are able to approach it on it's own terms and embrace it. In the end, it makes you realize just how real K-PAX is; and it makes you appreciate Prot's journey, and just how much we all share and have in common with those around us, human or alien. And it may just make you reflect upon your own journey-- where you've been and where you're going. And that's the magic of the movies. I rate this one 10/10.

Former [[Fei]] presidential candidate in deteriorating ... The former presidential candidate and movie [[gamers]] Fernando [[Peo]] Jr.'s condition has deteriorated after he suffered a stroke, doctors [[talked]] Monday.
Debbie Boone had a monster hit with her recording of the pop song "You Light Up My Life;" the Didi Conn film of the same name, however, was a horrifically embarrassing flop. Conn plays the stereotypically goofy-homely-vulnerable girl who is in love with Michael Zaslow, who plays the stereotypical yuppie-wannabe guy. They are engaged, but every one knows that Zaslow isn't going to marry any one that isn't blonde and built, so only Didi is surprised when he dumps her. Needless to say, Didi is quite embarrassed.  Fortunately, she has been doing a little songwriting in her spare time, and [[she]] [[is]] come up with a tune she thinks is pretty nifty. She calls it--can you guess?--"You Light Up My Life." She hops in the car and drives off to the big city to sell her song and make a new life. Now, I recall sitting in the theatre and watching her hop in the car to drive off to the big city, and thinking "Well thank heavens, we've finally got all the exposition out of the way. Now maybe something interesting will happen." And something interesting did happen. The credits rolled.  Yep, that was it. Not only was the movie badly acted, badly written, and badly filmed, it also ended in the middle. This movie is a really, profoundly bad movie, and we're not talking cult-movie-bad here. We're talking unmitigated flop, a real yawner from start to finish. If you liked the Debbie Boone song by all means buy a copy of it. But don't waste your time or money on this flick. This is one movie you'll be glad you missed.  Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer

[[Whopping]] value for money!  Highly [[advises]].    All prices include tax.  For $8 (veg.) or $9 (non-veg.) you will be completely filled by their 3-choice thali plates, which include salad, rice, NAAN, and papadum. The $5 wraps are also a fantastic value/quality.  The owner(?) and the gentleman with the turban are really nice.    I wish they would offer a bhuna or rogan josh (fish as a protein would be nice too!), and the washroom and decor should be improved, but but at least they usually play decent Indian music, and not crappy Top 40 radio!

The first review I saw of this on IMDB says that Vince Vaughn is a much better actor than Anthony Perkins was in this role. Makes me wonder if he saw the original. It's tough to review Psycho if you don't have the perspective of how revolutionary the movie was in 1960. You have a heroine who isn't very likable and is killed not far into the movie and a villain who is creepy, but makes you feel for him. Add to that some graphic violence and you have a blue print for some of the slasher films of the 80s and 90s.  Where does this [[cinematography]] go wrong? Let's start with casting. Anne Heche is fine as a Vivian Crane, but as Norman Bates, Vince Vaughn is all wrong. For one thing, he looks far too young. Secondly, he has no idea how to play the roll. His nervous laugh reminds me of Ron Howard trying to play a tough guy on Happy Days. [[Totality]] he does screams I DID IT! The [[primal]] movie, even to those who know everything about it, still makes you feel uneasy about the influence of mother on Norman, and turns her into a real separate character. How about the [[bain]] [[landscapes]]. When I finally saw the 1960 movie on a big screen, I was surprised at its power to scare the heck out of me. Bernard Herrman's score becomes incredibly shrill and loud and goes further toward scaring you than Danny Elfman's synth interpretations during the scene. This shower scene merely serves to show us Anne Heche's naked body and some nice color blood. Which brings us to the choice to film in color. Didn't work.  There is something about remaking classic films that hardly ever seems to work. Some may see this as a noble experiment, but honestly, if Gus Van Sant had nothing to add to this film, he should have left it alone

One of master director Alfred Hitchcock's finer films this is the story of an American and his family (James Stewart, Doris Day, and their young son) who are vacationing in north Africa. Stewart is a doctor and Day is a world famous singer. They meet a Frenchman who speaks the native language and helps them out of an incident on a local bus. Later one, the Frenchman whispers something into Stewart's ear after he is attacked and dying. The rest of the film is a puzzle as Stewart tries to save them and solve the mystery. The [[travesty]] is steeped in mystery and strangeness from the exotic locale to the odd occurrences. You never really know what's going on in this film, why people are appearing, until the end and even then you're not sure.

first watched this film years ago with my daughter who is now 13 and fell in love with the vampire. we both thought it was a top film, then watched sub 11 then sub 111 now i find there is sub 1v which i cannot wait to get my fangs on, and also there is a fifth in the pipe line. if no one has seen the movies. these are the best of the best. i think it deserver's a thousands Oscar's. i could watch these from morning to night.i would love to have a set of nails like he has, watch out girls. i [[dear]] it as all the story lines continues from film to film. these ant [[idiosyncratic]] vampire movies they are better. i would love to live in the life that is protruded in the films. it would make all my dreams come true

The submarine used was NOT Varangian! 'It' was in fact two boats, P614 and P615, both built for Turkey by Vickers Armstorng at Barrow-in-Furness but kept hold of by the Royal Navy for the duration of the war. P615 was sunk but P614 was eventually delivered in 1945.   The confusion no doubt arose because someone looked up P61 (as I did) and found Varangian! When in fact, the last digit of both P614 and P615 was in fact just painted out....  There are some [[hardly]] realistic moments in the film. These Turkish boats were very similar to the S-class. [[so]] no S-class submarines survive, the shots of them (as P61) and of the depot ship "Forth" form part of an interesting record now, as well as an [[interesting]] film.

This is a [[authentically]] [[homely]] film in the vein of "Buckaroo Banzai." The cast runs around like "Mad Max" wannabes, and they seem to be sharing a joke that they do not want to share with the audience. Wheeler-Nicholson is one of the those guilty pleasure actresses you are delighted to stumble across in films, but she isn't worth the price of rental. Space Maggot starts an electrical fire, and burns a vote of 4.

Poor acting; Poor [[setting]]; Awful adaptation; I mean, Far-Cry [[version]] was awesome, its like a true FPS [[player]], cool weapons and lots lots lots of "point and [[shot]]". [[that]] the movie we had nothing compared to the game.. Well we had some of the "point and shoot" thing but... i don't know how to explain, but if you ever watched another "Uwe Fail" movie you will understand. If you don't believe me, go to the website "petition online" and do a check for one named "Stop Uwe Bowl".  That movie made my eyes bleed, [[go]] [[get]] stop him for once.  Don't waste your time.

please why not put this [[fallacious]] film on DVD,i have been searching just like the previous writer for years, whats the hold up, or show it on TV. its so underestimated its one of the most romantic and beautifully written books i have ever read, and believe i have read some.I seem to think it was read on radio 4, but i can't find that either. Why not try and remake it even, i promise it will be top earner, people love those sorts of stories, So please either release it and take us out of our misery or remake it,although i doubt if it could be improved upon. Has any one read gone to earth by the same author or seen the film with Jennifer Jones, this is superb, but not to the same extent may be.

I ordered [[two]] dishes.  Green Curry Chicken - [[taste]] [[fabulous]], quality of food was good.  overall good, but i didn't like how expensive it was.  maybe its because there aren't [[regular]] thai restaurants that they can charge a lot, but i've had [[enough]] [[here]] elsewhere for [[slightly]] cheaper.  Basil Beef - I've never had basil beef that was served with ground beefuck  [[they]] usually get pieces/slices of beef, but this place [[serve]] it with ground beef.  after i realized it was [[called]] beef, i had only a little bit since it didn't taste all that good.  advice: don't order beef dishes, go with the chicken.
I used to [[dislike]] this place but it appears that the entire staff changed including the cooks. [[it]] ordered the salt and pepper shrimp because it's delicious. [[any]] time they battered and fried the shrimp with the shell still on. It [[immediately]] [[gets]] the purpose of battering the shrimp. You bite into it and your mouth is greeted by a shell. In order to [[process]] the shrimp, you have to peel the shell an batter off. [[sounds]] no sense. I was told by the [[previous]] manager Britney that it's always how its prepared. [[they]] dont [[deny]] it. I've ordered this dish before and it was never [[unlike]] this. Well [[at]] least the shrimp on my Singapore noodles were peeled...

I've been to this Subway twice and both [[juncture]] I have been [[dissuaded]].  Firstly - it [[showcase]] that none of the [[job]] behind the counter communicate well (mainly the cashier and the sandwich maker).  On two different occasions, spanning 2-3 months, I have been OVERCHARGED for my sandwich.  I have to check my receipt and then [[expecting]] another 5-10 minutes to get my [[refunded]].  The [[meeting]] line leaves much to be desired as well.  I did not want to "go there" but I clearly communicate what I want on my [[hoagie]] at other subways just [[magnificent]] but the [[manpower]] here [[displayed]] to [[wrestling]] with the English language.  [[me]] do frequent other Subways and they are very efficient in building sandwiches.  This one, not so much.  The management here really [[owe]] to train their workers better.

[[stop]] in for a bite while out running errands. We were confused because the guy inside was already putting chairs up on the tables and it was only 7ish (they close at 10). There were only two people ahead of us and it was taking forever! I was literally a second from walking out when Eric finally decided to help us. I got the 6" sweet onion chicken teriyaki on Italian bread with Swiss cheese. I didn't feel like toasted bread, so he just [[warmed]] up the chicken for me. These guys were so [[fast]] making sandwiches... After paying and getting our drinks, we sat down at one of the high top tables, since all the other chairs were up. Right when we started to eat, the two employees went outside to smoke, leaving the store completely [[hushed]]. We were amazed. The chicken in my sub was not the [[highest]] quality and [[they]] had to spit out some inedible pieces. Also there was a static-y [[sound]] playing Jingle Bell Rock cutting in and out. [[not]] annoying. We were finished eating by the time the two employees came back in from their smoke break. So irresponsible. Then they [[needed]] to empty all three tea dispensers like they were getting ready to close up shop. It was only 7:30! I bet they were planning to close the store early. These guys ought to be fired.

I always order the same thing here. At all chipotles really. I [[dislike]] the consistency. As with most places like this, they have standards to adhere to and this location does a fine job of that. I [[never]] know what I'm getting here. This location seems to be popular by the amount of people I [[sometimes]] see here.  Contrary to some reviews about this locations, I don't feel that they "skimp" on the portion sizes. I don't get beans, sour cream, sauces, or "extra" anything and it's still overflowing. It's [[not]] for me and I'm 6'1"... Although it IS pretty addictive so [[they]] [[never]] want more. Lol.   My recommendation would be to [[stay]] at non-peak hours because the line is significantly shorter.
then you will be a big fan of this movie. [[it]] [[basically]] the same basic concept, a [[little]] mixture of music, soul, and drama. I'll admit, i was a little [[enthusiastic]] about seeing this movie, I had only seen previews of a white trash [[can]] chained to a radiator, but I am a [[fantastic]] fan of Samuel L. Jackson and I [[adored]] Hustle & [[flows]] so i [[realised]] I would give it a chance.  I'm very glad that [[my]] did. It turned out to be more than just the surface story of a nymphomaniac southern girl being [[strangled]] by a 60 year old black man. The story had [[been]], and was very influential.  The music in this movie [[never]] added a nice touch. Craig Brewer mixed his [[version]] from Hustle & Flow into this movie, except took a [[musical]] spin and used the Blues. His musical scenes are [[certainly]] at the top of the charts as far as performance scenes go by. He [[then]] has very interesting flashback scenes and just gives you an overall crazy [[look]] during some of the more controversial scenes.  No doubt, if you liked Hustle & Flow, you will [[recommend]] this movie, and if you are a [[supporter]] of the blues you should definitely go an [[do]] this. I give it a 9 out of 10, very interesting film, and it is extremely under rated. shame.  Go out and rent this movie.

Boy I gotta tell ya - what a HUGE [[distaste]] this place was. I've been dieting for the last 5 months and have finally reached my goal - and then some, so I decided to treat myself (good behavior) and have some fast food. At first I thought Wendy's until I saw that famous In-N-Out sign and pulled right in. The service was impeccable, the food? Not so much. I ordered the single cheeseburger with fries and a [[profound]] [[casket]]. The [[bon]] on my [[berger]] was greasier than the burger itself - I could [[little]] [[holds]] on to it! The fries  -  although [[sensual]]  -  we're as dry as cardboard and actually tasted like cardboard...even my [[racine]] beer was weak - how the [[diablo]] can you [[bolt]] up a root beer?!?! Five [[month]] of [[strenuous]] [[tandem]] and my reward completely and totally sucked. Thanks...I really [[cannot]] [[got]] [[dispelled]] to Wendy's - [[perfectly]], next time!

Victor Sjöström was quite the master in this film, having starred in it, directed it and even wrote the screenplay! That's pretty amazing. While today few have any idea who Sjöström was, he might be familiar to Ingmar Bergman fans as the star one of Bergman's most acclaimed films, WILD STRAWBERRIES.  As far as this film goes, [[it]] [[is]] a very mixed bag. On one hand, you have to respect it because for 1921, it's a very good film. The idea of the Grim Reaper sitting down with a dead man to discuss his wasted life is pretty imaginative. Plus, the special effect of the Phantom Carriage is pretty convincing and technically speaking this is a well-crafted film. On the other hand, it's an amazingly dated and preachy film--more like something you'd expect to be shown in Sunday School instead of in an honest to goodness theater. Plus, some of the story elements just don't make sense. Instead of coming off as dedicated or good, the dying Salvation Army worker seems like a sap--a very sad and confusing sap. Why is she "in love" with this man? Am I missing something?  So, my recommendation is that if you are insanely in love with silents (like me), then by all means watch it. But, if you aren't a silent fan, this film might do nothing to convince you that this style film is brilliant because the story is so overly melodramatic and dated.
while it's nothing we haven't seen before from murphy , i spy is still [[recreational]] and enjoyable and so aggressively silly that it's more than a [[meaningful]] effort .
Oz, is one of the most mind-blowing and addictive TV experiences ever.  Having [[apprehended]] pieces of this on SBS, I was at first skeptical, however, having finished now the 4th season, I sadly know that that this [[sumptuous]] show is approaching its end, (6 seasons), and yet I [[instead]] can't get enough of OZ.   Want something that will push your senses and your stomach to the limit...[[Shred]] [[adjusting]] the bill, hands down.  This isn't kid's stuff, folks, its violent, brutal, and not pretty. Why, its a experimental unit inside a maximum security prison.  Tom Fontana's Oz is brilliant in all the right departments, the actors, the writing, and directing.  HBO's Oz site is also highly recommended, for newcomers, for info about this series. This was the first one-hour show, produced by HBO, and it proves what a master-work it is and that others would follow.  Thank-You HBO
[[[[Premise]]]]: I shan't stop you.">>>>[[[[Hypothesis]]]]: I will [[believe]] you.
[[we]] think I can safely say (without really giving anything [[back]]), that this movie had no robots in it. [[that]] guys in "[[action]]" costumes didn't act or speak as such, and the evil entity [[over]] the whole "plot" isn't a robot either.  [[the]] whole [[seem]] [[kinda]] [[about]] it was shot in a city park somewhere, with photos [[being]] in the background when the director needed a custom set. I [[may]] even use words to describe the acting...  This couldn't even [[describe]] the hilarious ending of "Star Crystal". In short, it is clearly one of the [[only]] sci-fi movies of the 80's and I [[will]] be so bold as to say "of all time".

I had an [[awful]] time here! I didn't have any services done, just paid $45 for the day pass. I sat in the different pools, enjoyed some tea, and just had a very relaxing hour. They provide you with everything you need - flip flops, hair cap, curling iron, hair gel, deodorant, toothpaste, etc. They were lacking the snacks department, only pretzels, bananas, apples and oranges. All the women were wearing swimsuits. I loved the multiple shower heads in the shower.

USAA is the best of the best of the best. I'm not kidding. They know what they're doing Everything from their website navigation, user friendly online banking, and their SUPERB customer service. "Really?" "Superb." "Keep it up." "Superb." "Say it again." "Superb."  Well, Empire Records quote out of the way, I have been with USAA ever since... forever. I was grandfathered in under my Dad who is a retired USAF Lt. Colonel. Actually, I first started dealing with them directly when I opened my first Master Card as an 18 year old before moving out and going to college. And then soon after I dealt with USAA's customer service line numerous times because my car loan and car insurance are through them.  Whenever I called them about anything their customer service representatives have been angels. I say they've been angels because compared to other customer service reps at other companies I've spoken to these people have to be from another plane of existence to consistently be so [[whopping]]. I've called crying [[for]] I locked my keys in my car, or just confused over something having to do with registering my car and not being [[potential]] to get my proof of insurance printed out in enough time (gee, the wonders of a irresponsible teenage college student). But every time they have been great. Going on 9 years now they have never let me down.  As soon as I snag myself a full time job I am moving my checking account over to USAA. They offer direct deposit and deposit from home. They also offer a set amount of money to be returned to your bank account at the end of every month if you happen to take out money at one of those nasty ATMs that charge you an arm and a leg for use. I hate that and knowing I could get that money back would be awesome.   My plan is to be with USAA forever. I have no reason to switch to anyone else. They've been in my family for a long time. My parents, me, my brother, and sister have all been with them for some reason or another and they have never done us wrong.

History and experience over the past couple of decades has shown us that intellectuals talking about sex is about the unsexiest and unintellectual thing anyone can do, but this wasn't quite as obvious back in 1986. Basically, the idea in this [[magic]] is that these characters insatiable drive to find comfort, security, and pleasure in sexual acts is actually the unhealthy motive that makes them so unbearable to themselves--which they hide from themselves with more sex. This drive is linked to "the decline of the American Empire", as expressed in an early interview within the movie.  So the idea is that relatively detestable people talk about sex, and that that talk is supposed to reveal how detestable they are as people. Arcand at least keeps giving it drive and momentum by doing interesting things with the camera such as isolating most of the characters in single frames, revealing their ultimate loneliness, and cutting rapidly between them, showing how they are more at war with each other than they are at agreement. And to give Arcand credit, this is pretty much what intellectual life is, a constant struggle with other intellectuals to stand out, even when everyone knows that standing out means standing alone.  But yeah, the characters and action are unsexy and kind of pathetic. I think this film is much more an aspect of its time than it is something meant to last, which makes it kind of dated. It's also the exact type of mental buffing in dialog and references to people like Susan Sontag that makes art-house films so unpopular around the populist entertainment moviegoers. In all, I'll take it anyway--it has its place basically among the exact type of people the characters are--it's just that it's not really interesting or important to anyone who isn't those characters.  --PolarisDiB
Sugar Factory, I had such high [[awaits]] for you! And you [[enables]] me down... and I'm a sugar addict!  Don't get me wrong, like others have stated SF has wonderful desserts.  There are a variety of baked goods, candies, ice creams, and other sugary goodness, but the food in the cafe was OK at best.  We ordered the [[wop]] and cheese pops (the only tasty item I had all night besides dessert). They were amazing! The sauce is off the chain! (Do people even say that anymore?) Definitely order these. You will NOT be disappointed.   I also started off with a Lollipop Passion [[Crystal]] cocktail. It was [[foreclosed]] and full of ice (and dried ice)! It was $36 and I didn't even get a buzz (weak)! They have a variety of different goblets available, with a hefty price tag and no pay off, I was reluctant to order another cocktail.  For dinner I ordered the French Dip which was tasteless and bland. Pretty much the worst French Dip I've ever had. My best friend had their sliders, which were okay. Nothing special. My mom had a pasta, which I tried and we both agreed it was flavorless. My sister ordered the BBQ pizza which was pretty dang good, but not mind blowing. We were all pretty disappointed with our over priced food and under performing beverages.  We ordered dessert, we got the cookie jar sundae. It had every type of cookie on it, plus ice cream, and lots of fresh whipped cream. It was delightful. And definitely meant to be shared. This ended the meal on a nice note.  The service was excellent. The restaurant was clean. The entire staff was awesome. No complaints here on that end.   I had such high hopes for this place! I really did, but it's a more expensive, less tasty version of the Cheesecake Factory.  As for people saying this place is fancy, give me a break. There were all walks of life here. The girls and guys going to the club, the grandmas, the Europeans with their fanny packs, and every other class and creed.  Stop in and get dessert and then bounce. There is a candy shop, a bar, and a chocolate lounge in this same space as well.  Sorry Sugar Factory, you just aren't that sweet.

I've always found the dilettante Man Ray and his artistic efforts to be deeply pretentious, and I've never understood why his work attracts so much attention. Apart from his Rayographs (which he invented by accident, and which are merely direct-contact photo prints), his one real contribution to culture seems to be that he was the first photographer to depict female nudity in a manner that was accepted as art rather than as porn. But surely this had to happen eventually, and there's no real reason why Ray deserves the credit. The critical reaction to Man Ray reminds me of the story about the Emperor's New Clothes.  "L'Étoile de merde" ... whoops, "de mer" ... features a lot of blurry photography and a recurring visual theme of a starfish, which is never explained. Starfishes have the fascinating ability to regenerate lost limbs -- and even to regenerate entire duplicate bodies -- but, if that has anything to do with this movie's theme, [[Mikhail]] neglects to say so. I was much more impressed by this movie's title cards, which (in French) manage to include rhymes, a pun ('Si belle, Cybele') and some portmanteaux.  As so often in Ray's work, there is indeed a beautiful young woman seen in this movie. Unfortunately, the photography is (largely) so blurred that we have little opportunity to appreciate her. I'll rate this mess one point out of 10.

[[That]] is one of the best looking films of the [[latest]] few years. The fact that it was done on a virtual shoestring ($1.8 million or so they say on the DVD:they [[inferred]] that they ended up with even less financing) makes it all the more [[amazing]]. Not simply the photography, but the design and particularly the locations (Eastern Montana) which are at once authentically American and otherworldly.  Too bad there isn't a coherent movie to go with it. An extremely promising setup of the last 48 hours of clearing out a rural town in 1955 before it will be flooded for a dam is washed away with pretentious mumbo jumbo [[insinuating]] to angels and a dying child. And what is presented as the "real world" is [[irrevocably]] arch. Note to the Polish Brothers:the Coen Brothers are funny-you are not.  No doubt many cineastes will find "Northfork"'s abundant symbolism and inscrutability as marks of some sort of profundity, the sort that sophisticated types wrestle the night away with in coffeehouses while the braindead masses watch "Charlie's Angels" or something. (Sigh) If you insist....  In the meantime, recommended only as a case study for filmmakers for its' impeccable technical credits and photographic beauty.
I remember seeing this [[flick]] in the theater in 1984 when I was 6 years-old (you do the math). I absolutely [[hated]] it. I was Tarzan for the 2 [[minutes]] after seeing it (climbing the furniture, jumping around making monkey sounds). It started a fascination with Tarzan and monkeys, but oddly enough a longer [[developed]] love for Christopher Lambert (keep in mind that [[he]] [[met]] Highlander very shortly after this). 1984 was the last [[reason]] I saw that film, until about a [[minutes]] ago. It happened to be on cable as [[my]] was [[making]] ready for bed at 3:30 am and [[so]] [[if]] it was late and I was tired and [[you]] had to be at work at 9:[[30]] am, I stayed up to watch this [[films]] that I loved as a kid.   Upon viewing it [[it]] realized that it was not that great of a film and even odder then that, that Andie [[porter]] voice was dubbed by someone else. Ian Holme was of [[fact]] solid as usual, and [[well]] the monkey suits [[actually]] kind of held up, but what was most [[curious]] was how good Lambert was as Tarzan. He was great! [[any]] depth he managed to capture in so few [[things]], his primal body language and most importantly his ability to bring this character through its extremely large ark, were just amazing.  As I stated earlier I am Lambert fan, but I'm used to Highlander, The Hunted and Fortress. In this film he was really quite good and it is a shame that he never got a chance to portray a character with such depth again.  So to make a short story way too long, I was a little disappointed that the film was not that good, but I was glad to see that Lambert was good and I do not regret staying up until 6:00am to see it.

Marla English and Lance Fuller are two petty crooks in search of African gold.Acting lessons for Ms English should have been at the top of the search list.She's a bad girl and lets everybody know it in a performance worthy of a junior high school play.Mike "Touch" Connors is the white guide English & Fuller con into leading the expedition.  English & Conway finally meet and it is a match made in [[love]].She is the perfect subject to become his voodoo creature because she'll do anything (stress anything) to get what she wants.You will do anything to stop the agony of this movie at this point.  What made this movie interesting for me was Conway wearing that funky tribal hat/headdress/floral piece!Still trying to figure out what kind of dead animal it was.Guess he thought if he pulled it down low enough over his eyes nobody would recognize him.  Truly bad cinema.

I was a [[vent]] of the AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON movie and so was curious whether a 16-year later sequel could be done with French language and local re-cast major, supporting, and minor characters. Tonight I watched the "[[revisions]] for FOX Network" version that was some [[classifies]] of curious hybrid of several [[hyper]] sequels. The screenwriters and directors pay homage to certain of the key plot concepts: Tourist gets wolf bite, full moon comes out, boy meets girl, boy becomes beast, boy dies heroic death after help from ghost victim. For me, the oddest aspect of this "formula" teen horror special effect-ride was the casting of the school teacher-love interest of the TV comedy "ED" as one of the werewolf's clueless victims who is more or less totally unsympathetic in the scripted lines they handed her. I haven't seen another horror-flick that this movie is "sequelling" (a vampire fighting flick titled BLADE), but I guess that parts of its plotline must [[interpreting]] how villain werewolves (they're spoofish) are threatening the "good" werewolf pair during a long part of the movie. There is also a final conflict in a Paris subway train, a la SPEED. This 1997 studio product is an odd hybrid of a film since considerable technical effects are shown for scary purposes but the authentic terrors of the original have been completely undermined, in my opinion. Such an odd re-write of the werewolf legend and "movie-mythology" !?! My suggestion to those considering this at the video store -- go for a classic "top of the line" Thriller instead : Alfred Hitchcock's PSYCHO!

Bottom line is that this is a real deal local place and the guy that runs it doesn't take any crap.  Note that it has limited hours (basically just weekday lunchtime) and that you must pay in cash.  The motley crew of young student types that work there are sincere and helpful, just trying to get people fed and out the door!

Detective Verlac comes out of retirement to catch the supernatural thief.  This is a [[fantastic]] enough, if you haven't seen any other incarnations of "Belphégor" before. If you have, I recommend skipping this particular version as it can't help but pale in comparison to the others despite the [[great]] locals and scenery.It plays out like a (slightly) higher [[set]] Sci-Fi Original film, and I don't really mean that as a compliment.

What some Hollywood-movies try and practically never succeed, creating somehow metaphysical [[connectivity]] between [[whoever]] (without becoming [[inaccessible]]), [[directs]] this beautiful movie perfectly [[satisfactorily]] (resembling in that way a little to the wonderful '[[De]] Double Vie [[en]] Veronique' of the same director and with the same [[super]] actress). This is a REAL movie, that changes [[visions]] of [[resides]] a little bit - intelligent and beautiful [[romances]], [[shrewdly]] directed, [[peachy]] main actors, masterful cinematography.

Alexander Lou, star of classics such as 'The Super Ninja' and 'Mafia vs Ninja' headlines here in this [[droll]] martial arts fest.  The plot involves the evil Abbott White (who boasts some humongous and frankly somewhat scary looking white eyebrows) enlisting the aid of a ninja clan in order to overthrow the Shaolin Temple.  This goal he achieves and furthermore wipes out most of it's members, although needless to say, one or two do manage to survive and rather predictably go on to exact eventual revenge upon the miscreant Abbott.  ....Ok so the plot isn't exactly pushing the envelope in terms of creativity but does anyone watching a film with a title like 'Wu Tang vs Ninja' aka 'The Ninja Hunter' really care much for such an inconsequential factor as a plot? Of course not! - It's the fights that matter in these films and by gum - you get your moneys worth here! There's some superbly choreographed martial arts on display from everyone involved in this and rarely a minute seems to goes by without a fight breaking out for some reason.

Went through drive-thru because it seemed like the quickest option to try this place out and it was [[marvellous]]. Pulled up, looked at their menu which was pretty small (like in and out) that consisted of chicken based food items. I got their big chicken box thing which cost like $7~ that came with 4 chicken strips/their special sauce/good tasting fries/coleslaw/a medium drink and a very tasty piece of bread looking thing. The quality was superb for a drive-thru that was pretty quick (comparing it to in and out this place was very fast for the quality of food).   The price is right. Their chicken is [[striking]] and the sauce is actually really good- I originally asked for a side of BBQ sauce during the drive-thru transaction as I was unaware of their sauce which happened to turn out really good (they don't have BBQ sauce anyways as I found out).   I won't be going back to KFC. Highly recommend at least trying it.

I also attended the RI International Horror Film Festival and I can easily see why this film won [[better]] of show.  SEA OF DUST is a wild romp of Horror, [[Shtick]] and [[sumptuous]] scenery. A back in time tale of strange goings on. An increasingly wide spread [[indisposed]] with an overwhelmingly irritating side effect of people's heads exploding, brings a young Professor's apprentice; Stefan, to investigate. Along his travels, he decides to briefly detour and once again ask for his long time love's hand in marriage, only to once again be sent packing by her extremely stubborn father  Along the way "out of town" he comes across an ill girl in the road and delivers her to Dr. Maitland, (brilliantly played by up and coming Vincent Price like actor: Edward X Young.) Who fills Stefan in on the Evils a foot. Only the Dr. is insulted that he had called for the Professor and only received a boy in training None the less, Stefan turns out to be much more than a common bystander. Horror Icon; Tom Savini portrays the ultimate religious torment monger; Prester John. Scream Queen; Ingrid Pitt comes out of retirement to give a stellar performance as Anna. Many beautiful and talented supporting actors seamlessly held the story together and helped to effectively move it along to the climax.  Dark Religion and over the top, but fun and sometimes very original, gore scenes play heavily in this Hammer tribute flick. This stylish movie goes back and forth between flashbacks, surreal worlds, dreams and the character's reality.  Horror and Gore aside; This is also a very Funny movie! Slapstick, tongue and cheek humor and dark comedy raise their heads among the dark story line. Like others have stated; this really is like three great movies in one. Very Entertaining and Original.
This was just telecast here in the U.S. Others have commented on the [[fidelity]] (or lack of same) to the novel; the 1983 BBC version is far superior on this and all other counts. Given the scope of the novel, it should not have been condensed to 85 minutes. Key sections have to be rushed or [[insinuated]] to, or omitted; there barely enough time just to get in the chronology of events, so character development has to be [[shot]]: we cannot get much of a sense of who the people are, which robs us of what makes Austen so great.  One major negative for me was the cinematography, which I thought was just [[abhorrent]], and quite literally [[abhorrent]]. The camera is constantly doing ultra-closeups, and swirling around and around in circles. Maybe on a small TV box this is OK, but on our 40" hi-def screen it was so literally dizzying that both my wife and I had to look away from the set repeatedly (my Dramamine supply had run out). Of course, this did [[entertain]] from the rather lackluster I'm-just-reading-what's-in-the-script acting (isolated scenes are nicely done, but not enough to save things).  Adding up the score so far in the Complete J.A. Sweepstakes: I'd rate "Northanger Abbey" a success, because of superior direction and production values (and the story lends itself better to short treatment), "Persuasion" OK (though not the equal of other versions, with condensation again being at fault), both far ahead of this attempt. I will hope for better in the two remaining novels in this TV Reader's Digest Jane Austen; like others, I am thankful they left P & P alone!

I love bad movies: Showgirls, Plan 9 from Outerspace, so on. And this movie fits right in. Don't believe anyone who tells you this is good film. It's downright [[frightful]]. Tim Curry's accent moves from German to Portuguese to Hungarian. There's a person in a gorilla suit who is supposed to be able to communicate using a glove that interprets the ape's sign language.

please why not put this fantastic film on DVD,i have been searching just like the previous writer for years, whats the hold up, or show it on TV. its so underestimated its one of the most romantic and beautifully written books i have ever read, and believe i have read some.I seem to think it was read on radio 4, but i can't find that either. Why not try and remake it even, i promise it will be top earner, people love those sorts of stories, So please either release it and take us out of our misery or remake it,although i doubt if it could be improved upon.

I have been a Cafe Rio lover since the first time I had a salad there in SLC, Utah. We usually frequent the Gilbert/Baseline location and were thrilled when they opened San Tan since it's closer to our house. The food was just as [[befitting]] as always- I love the beef barbacoa salad and my husband loves the steak burrito. Portions are large, so sometimes we share. The queso is to die for, and we love that they give free "nino quesadillas" for young children. My 2 year old eats every bite and I don't have to be upset later that I spent money on a kids meal that went uneaten. Taco Tuesday is the best- and I still leave completely [[overstuffed]] after just one taco.  Now, beware- this location gets CRAZY busy with the white shirt and tie crowd coming in from the Gilbert LDS temple around the corner. It's often difficult to find a table and the line can be long.  I would definitely recommend to them that they not allow seating until you have your food in hand, as there are always huge parties taking up several tables pushed together that sit around and chat when they haven't ordered yet. Otherwise this is a spot we will continue to visit!

Spoiler Alert   I have never seen comments on a movie, that I disagree with more then the comments people made on this. One could learn from critical viewings of this [[travesty]]. As an educational film, I rate it highly because it teaches "how to succeed"! We do not watch movies to learn; we generally watch for entertainment. As entertainment, I rate it low: the ending is downbeat and cerebral/intellectual. This conflict results in my eight star rating. The movie follows Jane Craig (Holly Hunter), a television news producer. The network executive introduces Tom Grunnick (William Hurt), to study for the on air news anchor position. Tom immediately charms people with humbleness. Another potential news anchor has been waiting for years for his on air opportunity, Aaron Altman (Albert Brooks). Altman knows all news stories, inside and out.  The Network executive wants Grunnick on the air and Jane argues, saying Grunnick is not ready, he doesn't know the news. They do not listen to her. Forced to place Grunnick on the air, Jane contacts Altman to get information on the news story and relays Altman's comments through an earpiece to Grunnick while Grunnick speaks. We watch the sharp contrast between Altman's/Jane Craig's words and Grunnick's, as Grunnick skillfully rewords everything Altman and Jane Craig say in his ear, in order to make it understandable, likable and entertaining the audience. Altman gets a chance on air and the network execs require him to seek coaching from Grunnick, the new guy. This new (news ingnorant) guy coaching him? This is something Altman does not see justified, but agrees reluctantly.   Grunnick coaches Altman and gets excited noting hundreds of Altman's shortcomings in appearance, audio and vocabulary. Altman never considered these things before, when he became an expert on the news itself. The complexity of understanding what Grunnick taught him, causes Altman to have a panicked sweating attack ("Flop Sweat") when he is on the air. Grunnick eventually becomes the top network anchor and Altman resigns prior to being fired. But Grunnick fails in his attempt for a romance with Jane Craig, because she finds out from Altman, that Grunnick sometimes fakes circumstances in order to make people like him. This turns her off of him. This sends the message that in relationships, we want people who are genuine and not trying to make us like them.   This movie sends the message that getting people to like you is the most important skill in a job, but it is especially true in Broadcast News. There are many people commenting on how this is the dumbing down of TV News and how Grunnick represents a good looking, but dumb guy or all style, but no substance. The opposite is true, Grunnick possessed skills and very complex intellect, to get people to like him, including the presence of mind to know exactly how he appears and sounds, when he is on camera (He coaches Altman to Punch a word in every sentence). Grunnick's flaw that costs him the relationship with Jane Craig, is that he is too driven to be likable and will fake a situation. Many people are calling Altman very intelligent or brilliant. Altman played by Brookes is not as intelligent as Grunnick and the "Flop Sweat" scene shows that his mind could not handle the complexity that Grunnick handles when on the air. Altman is angered by this fact that he knew the news and Grunnick suceeded more by getting people to like him. There are also people commenting that these things are exclusive to the TV News industry. The concept that winning friends is the most important skill in a job, is obviously, not popular, but my experience indicates it is true in most jobs. As an education on how to succeed, this movie is fantastic, albeit unpopular. Educational, yes, but it does not have an uplifting ending.
This was a [[terrible]] movie. It had one "sot-so-nice" outburst. Plus there were some very intense (drama) scenes which might make it inappropriate for younger viewers, under 6.  For a under the radar film, the acting was quite enjoyable, and touched down in our family room for a near perfect landing. It held the attention of our whole family and we were kind of sorry to see it end.  This movie had elements of spy kids with young people saving the day, but was given a somewhat more believable scenario. The dream scenes were a distraction at first, but did a great deal to establish the plot. The pranks and hi-jinx were also quite amusing.  We hope you like as much as we did.

OK...So I [[already]] gave this place 5 stars which says there is no place to go, but Walker furniture. I still think the experience of buying furniture was great there. For the most part, I love my furniture. I did research the quality of the sofa and loveseat that we bought and I still believe that was the right purchase for us. On the other hand...the recliner chair that we bought has been a problem. I didn't sit in it until after it was a month old...crazy me... When I did sit in it and reclined, the frame broke. OMG! First time sitting in it (a pricey chair) and it broke. I called Walker and they scheduled someone to come out more than one week later. I got over that. I had to stay home from work for someone to come over. What I can't get over is that they sent a person out to "check out the situation" He came in, looked at the chair, said, yes you have a broken frame and I'll have to call it in. They will schedule someone to come out and pick up the chair to take it back in for repair. So you ask...What am I upset about? So, so many things...#1 The person that comes to "check out the situation" should be prepared to take the furniture with them at that time. #2. I don't want a repaired chair which the frame was broken. #3. Now I"m going to have to take off work for someone to pick up the chair and take off work for them to return it. As I'm thinking about it and getting angry all over again, I'm going to be forced to give them 1 star instead of the three that I was going to give. (keep in mind that I originally gave them 5 stars)...They don't give you an option to say morning, afternoon or evening. They just give you a 2 hour window of when they will be there. I'm sure most of the people that shop there are working class citizens. Do they think people can take a total of four days off of work (original delivery + 3 days for repair) for something that was not the customer's fault. Well, I take that back...It was my fault. If I hadn't sat in the darn chair, it would not have broken...So, to make a long story short...Walker furniture will not be getting my NEW business EVER again. Actually, they owe me my vacation days that I have to use for buying a piece of "suspect" furniture.

The few scenes that actually attempt a depiction of revolutionary struggle resemble a hirsute Boy Scout troop meandering tentatively between swimming holes. When Sharif or, please God, Palance try their hand at fiery oratory, they sound like Kurtz swallowing a bug. The displays of strategic brilliance incorporate a map of Cuba replete with smiling fishies in the ocean, and a positively Vaudevillian hypothesis on how the Bay of Pigs came to pass. What does that leave us with? One comical dentistry scene; a surfeit of uppity Hollywood peasants who address the camera as though it were a moving train; and, just for kicks, a passel of homoeroticism that is not limited to Castro's manic and unremitting cigar-fellatio. Never trust a Medved, but even a busted clock is right twice a day: this is a HISTORICALLY [[frightful]] movie.

I love movies in this genre. Beautiful girls, toilet humor, gratuitous nudity. So why didn't I like this movie? No movie like this should [[be]] even the slightest confusion to the plot. Who's who, where is the [[thing]], it's not SE7EN, just make me laugh. [[thinking]] it's me, but i never felt this [[helpless]] watching American Pie movies or any other more modern National Lampoon's movies. This movie has no [[end]] that keeps me smiling, waiting for what's next. Instead, I find myself stopping to think, "Why did they keep that scene?" I do not [[get]] this movie. If you are expecting Van Wilder, think again. The only [[time]] I had watching this movie was guessing what movies the actors were in when they were kids. 2/10 generously.

An astronaut gets lost in deep space and finds himself traveling through unknown territory on board of a living spaceship accompanied by a group of alien-outlaws. This incredible plotted and [[laughable]] TV-installment comes along as a positive birth-fantasy. The individual characters, in conflict at the beginning of the series, have to learn to get along with each other and evolve into a powerful group at last. Most of the action takes place inside the womb of Moia, the living space-ship (who even gets pregnant and gives birth to another ship!). While science-fiction-stories are usually interested in negative birth-fantasies (watch the 'Alien'-movies for example, especially the fourth part 'Resurrection') this comes as a surprise. Also enjoyable is the absence of military hierarchy on board of the ship and the positive attitude towards sex and the human (and alien) body. One of the female characters who is actually a plant experiences 'photogasms' while being exposed to sunlight. The crew even has to go to the toilet. Wouldn't that be impossible in 'Star Trek'?

Over the last 12 months my wife, [[brother]] and brother in law have made it a point to visit your business and we have become regulars at your [[venue]], having a good time, enjoying your food, entertainment and [[also]] [[earned]] a lot of money. We have also turned your business [[positively]] on for many of our friends and family over the [[last]] [[5]] months. This evening 4/19/2013 (from 5pm-6:30 pm) we [[welcomed]] [[again]] to our favorite Irish Pub, our first time [[abroad]] since Saint Patrick's Day. We were having a great [[talk]] when we were asked by a waitress with blond [[ique]] right before our meals were to be [[had]] if she could move our table down. [[in]] explaining the true intentions she started separating our tables. We were sitting at two, [[4]] tops, the four of us. At first we didn't ask why but soon after were [[found]] that the intention was to put the four of [[it]] [[toward]] a single two top and that this was policy. You're were not [[actually]] at full capacity! So I said no. After we got our [[dinner]], without our coleslaws, the service of your staff became distant and we received looks from the blond that were not complimentary. On leaving is when we [[bothered]] her with our dissatisfaction, one in our party could not even eat his meal and asked for it to go. I have been in the restaurant business for 30 years, and for all the reasons we came back as customers to the new Pour House, is now why we will not return. Our business is a word of mouth business, and I plan to retract my support with many that I have previously made "glowing" recommendations to. I guess now that your business is thriving again under your ownership that you can afford to run business off with the practice of trying to use every chair possible, and making your customers uncomfortable. If this is not your intention as an owner, please feel free to explain.

Yes, at times "Unconditional Love" overwhelms as it bounces -- no, as it ricochets -- from one story element to another in the most unconventional use of thematic elements and characters. In fact, it wasn't until I watched the film for the second time that I began to understand what I think P.J. Hogan might have been attempting to do with this quirky, [[unorthodox]] flick. Perhaps the entire film itself is a metaphor for the unconditional love for which Grace (Kathy Bates) yearns and describes in the later part of the film. Grace insists that unconditional love is just that, without condition and without qualification. So I watched "Unconditional Love" again with that in mind. I laughed much more than I did the first time, I became more involved with the characters, I began to understand the, at times, absurd turns the story takes. The performances are often over the top but no more than they need to be to fit Hogan's weird and whacky vision, a vision which moved me to tears, yearning and outbursts of side-splitting laughter. Yes, Hogan is asking a great deal of his audience. But I for one have come to truly love his film -- unconditionally.

Ever since he played a goon in Lone Wolf McQuade, actor/[[trimming]] Kane Hodder has been busy. His film, Hatchet, got all the publicity last year, but he still makes a couple of more films every year. He should have [[omitting]] this one.  Hodder seems to be the [[roi]] of the slashers. he has played Jason Voorhees from 1988's Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood (1988) to Jason X (2001). He is working on a new film that appears to be a Halloween remake. He is very much what I would call the serial killer type with his methodical, expressionless thirst for blood.  However, there wasn't much blood in this movie and very [[kiddo]] [[endeavor]] occurred on camera. It felt as if I was watching an episode of real law enforcement on A&E.  I won't put the blame entirely on Hodder's shoulders, as the rest of the [[entertainers]] didn't [[promotes]] much either.  Michael Berryman (The Hills Have Eyes, The Devil's Rejects) just ran his mouth until Gein shut him up. Adrienne Frantz ("The Bold and the Beautiful") was [[delightful]]. Veteran actress ("Three's Company") and Penthouse Pet, Priscilla Barnes did a credible job. I am sure there are other horror favorites, but they all just seemed to run through their roles.

After starting watching the re-runs of old Columbo movies, I thought they would all get about the same vote from me (6). But apparently I'm now starting to see differences in the movies. It happened in some of just previous episodes, that showed some pretty genius directing, and it shows in this one, but in the negative way.  The movie was so boring, that I sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching (never happened during a Columbo movie before!), and sometimes it was so embarrassing that I had to look away. The directing seems too pretentious. The scenes with the "oh-so-mature" neighbour-girl are a misplace. And generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode. Then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter (who falsely was accused for the murder) is pure horror, really [[good]].  Some applause should be given to the "prelude" however. In this episode, a lot of focus is given on how the murderer tries to secure his alibi and hide the evidence etc. I really liked that. [[plus]] alas, no focus on how Columbo reveals all this. And the "proof" that in the end leaves Columbo victorious is the silliest ever.  Rating: lies between 4 and 5

One would [[perceptions]] that with all the lavish care and [[loads]] that went into this made-for-TV [[films]], it would [[illustrates]] something of the taste and manners of the upper class couple--Wallis Simpson and the Prince of Wales--instead of being a [[mournful]], unappetizing [[yesteryear]] romance.  Nor is it helped by the fact that JANE SEYMOUR and [[ANTON]] ANDREWS give stiff, rather uncomfortable to watch performances in which the events move much too slowly to hold [[caution]].  It's hard to understand why a star of OLIVIA [[PER]] HAVILLAND's caliber would wish to play the supporting role of Aunt Bessie since the role is [[once]] colorless she just about fades out of sight. At this stage in her career, Olivia was appearing in so many "nobility" roles requiring a [[royale]] [[attending]] but nothing more.

I have a 4yr old daughter, and before this movie she was all about the Disney princesses, now she watched this [[travesty]] and all she can talk about is Princess Genevieve, and all her sisters. I definitely recommend this movie for all young girls. This movie is one of the best from the Barbie collection. It shows all the good values that any mother would love to encourage on there little girls. With the great songs and dance moves, it gets my daughter up and trying to mimic the moves. The extras are also good, one even works on how good your memory is. I would definitely have say it is a must see for kids and grown-ups alike.

When a loser teen is bitten by an insect, he becomes the superhero Dragonfly...  Superhero Movie is the latest spoof movie to hit the screens. Sadly however, despite the presence of David Zucker (who was involved with Airplane!, Top Secret and The Naked Gun movies) it still suffers from the fault most recent spoofs have...mainly it's more [[beast]] than fun! The fault mainly lies with the gags. It's simply not funny enough. Some of the jokes do work, such as the nail gun scene, but other parts simply fall flat. The X-men spoof for example, or the whole farting sequence. Blazing Saddles this isn't! One of the key things about the best spoof movies, like Airplane is that although the dialog is extremely funny, the cast for the most part play is completely straight. This makes it even [[sillier]]. Even when there is simple dialog in the foreground, there may well be funny things happening behind the cast. Again funny. The other key thing is that they all have a plot of sorts, to hang the gags on.  The recent trend seems to be to take scenes from various movies, THEN try and spoof them. As a result the so-called plot of these movies very rarely exist. Another flaw these movies have, is that some of the scenes were actually funny in the original versions, and in most cases even funnier than the spoof scene! The cast try to get into the spirit required, but with a lot of unfunny dialog and scenes, it's hard to get worked up about it.  As recent spoof movies go, it's not as bad as Epic Movie, Date Movie, or the awful Meet The Spartans, but considering that some people involved here have made good, funny movies in the past, it's nowhere near good enough.

....and now I'm up to episode #7. I really was hoping it'd be over by now (not to mention canceled, once everything connected with the show -including the actors - had been dumped along with some toxic waste in the middle of the ocean somewhere, never to be seen again), because this series really is [[terrific]].   To have this program listed under the genre of 'comedy' is at best misleading! It's so hard to believe Ben Elton could write something this bad, maybe this points to a lot of input from the other writers in everything he's been connected with before. In some episodes I haven't even laughed once!  Oh, and I can't believe Ardal O'Hanlon actually stopped doing 'My hero' & started doing this instead, his decision making skills were obviously impaired that day - perhaps he simply can't read, and didn't realise just how poor the scripts for 'Blessed' were. Don't get me wrong, 'My Hero' is not masterpiece, but it's a million times better than this piece of junk.  And just to annoy me even more I bet this gets a DVD release as well, when there are so many great TV series' that aren't getting released!

It's almost [[humorous]] how bad this [[venues]] is. It's all been [[affirms]] before me, but here's just some of what makes this a [[dire]] place to stay.   1) no AC. I came in January so no REAL need for it except that both rooms I had were set to 80 degrees at check in and it took forever to cool down with the warm air just circulating.   2) absolutely and completely filthy. There were crumbs on the furniture and rando hairs all over the bathroom in both rooms I tried. 2nd room [[thought]] like 20 years of smoking have been going on.   3) The phones in my 2nd room didn't work very well and when I [[ultimately]] [[attained]] to my [[message]] it was just a sales pitch from Embassy Suites.   4) elevators are [[amazingly]] [[lent]].

"East Side Story" is a documentary of musical comedy in Stalinist Russia and later in the eastern European satellite comedies, with many clips from the films and commentary from the survivors. [[But]] some of the Stalinist films look laughingly bad (The Bright Road (?) being a notable exception), the films from the sixties actually look pretty good. "My Wife Wants to Sing," "The White Mouse," and "Midnight Revue" look particularly [[distracting]]. The producers had to contend with the censors, who had the power to decide what was politically correct, which led to some confusion, [[droll]] in retrospect, since the people whom the censors were trying to appease were the very people who supported making the films to begin with! Since musical comedies were fairly rare behind the Iron Curtain--there were only something like forty made in forty years--they had a disproportionate effect upon their audiences, who made major hits of some of the films.  I notice that the sound for the sixties films was much better. The directors often had to make do with antiquated equipment, and stringent power regulations--they had to film in seven minute takes or less--and dangerous officicrats.  I also notice that "West Side Story" seems to have had a strong influence on "Hot Summer." The later films may not measure up to "Singin' in the Rain," but they certainly look like they beat the hell out of "Bye Bye Birdy"

If you are planning to schedule your program for a film festival, do not be misled by what it says in the booklet. This is a complete [[scale]] of time and energy. I have watched Bunuel, I have seen Dali, and admired them; but this isn't surrealism, this is not supposed to BE at all. Didn't they ever think about the reputation of human race while taking this picture? After we become extinct by global warming, these will be the remainings of our civilization. What if the aliens sample this as an example of our intellectual capital? With all due respect to the effort put in this, maybe it would be a good idea to terminate all the copies of this film - or whatever it is.
The [[suppositions]] of the story is common enough; average family wants out of the rat race; wants to find the simple life....so they move from Sherman Oaks,California to Lake Tomahawk; kids in tow.  The lake is beautiful, they have leased an old house....but wait; there may be something in the lake; people are being murdered, and no one knows how (never mind why). Gerald McRaney is [[sumptuous]], a familiar face for Lifetime viewers; Valerie Harper is also good; since this [[moviemaking]] was made in '88 maybe the writer should produce a sequel!.  You will also enjoy Barry Corbin as the town eccentric, and [[Darrell]] Anderson as a Bruce Dern-lookalike/crazed military man.  While the story plot is a bit over the top; if you are a movie buff you will be reminded of similar scenarios from ""Psycho""; ""Deliverance""; as well as other horror stories of that genre. Several camera shots and sequences will give you a sense of deja vu.  Sit back and enjoy; if you don't take it too seriously it is very entertaining; and better than, for example the more recent movie:  ""I Know What You Did Last Summer""; it seems they made better movies in the good old 80's!.
[[[[Premise]]]]: oh [[not]]>>>>[[[[Hypothesis]]]]: Constantly
Joline (Heather Graham) married Carl (Luke Wilson) and about five hundred and some days later, Carl is very depressed and leaves her, expecting to `clean the fog' in their lives. Joline faces her marriage as an important commitment to the end of her life, and decides to look for Carl in Texas. She is very supported by her brother Jay (Casey Affleck), who meets her in the border of Mexico. There, Joline meets the confused Carl and realizes that she can not change his decision, while Jay knows Carmen (Patricia Velasquez) and starts dating her, and in the end `life goes on'. This [[films]] is very unpredictable, having a [[incredibly]] [[assorted]] story. I believe it is an independent production. In some parts, it is a little slow and boring, but there are certain dialogs that [[implies]] this movie worthwhile. I liked it, and my vote is seven.  Title (Brazil): `Rebeldes Até o Fim' (`Rebels Until the End')

Two page boys working at a radio network go from trying to solve murders to performing in black-face in between work shifts. Jack Moran and Sidney Miller star in this whodunnit from 1945. Lots of fast talking, everybody [[shout]] at everybody, and the two page boys call the police detective "Marty" (played by Ralph Sanford). It's a real "shortie" at 59 minutes, and it has the feel of being adapted from a play, since it mostly takes place in a radio station soundstage. We don't really care about any of the characters, which is probably why its hardly ever shown. [[Nada]] big deal. This was Phil Karlson's second film as director. We're not given any clues as to who might be knocking people off, so we just kind of follow the police detective and the page boys as they all try to solve the mystery first. I'll say no more so as not to give away any spoilers.

I am currently watching this movie and I have absolutely no hesitation in reviewing it now. The acting is [[awesome]]. Half the cast must be retired porno actors, and to get kicked off pornos you could imagine the quality of acting.  The graphics are unlike anything I have ever seen. I think there are puppet shows with more believability. They can't even afford blanks for the guns they shoot at the pathetic excuse for monsters. Perhaps I should also note how incredibly impressed I am at the number of 'bullets' their pistols can hold.   If asked to summarise the movie, I would say that someone had rustled up a group of complete no-hopers at the local county-fair, slapped them on an island, added needlessly intense music and let a 6 year old do the editing.  I can honestly not formulate any possible explanation for why this movie was released, recorded on DVD and costs $6 from my local video store for one day. If anything I have received the benefit of knowing that I am a lot smarter than all parties involved in this film.  I [[feel]] this movie with great intensity. Why? I wish I knew Captain, I wish I knew....

I returned to this place on my second visit over a few weeks time. Z Pizza [[hectares]] 7 salad menu, 8 sandwiches, and many pizza choice selections or build it yourself in different sizes. Or you can order  the slice(s) and usually they will have 4 flavors available that rotates on a daily basis. When I came in with my party, we had the choice of Hawaiian, egg plant, pepperoni and cheese. I ended up ordering the chicken curry sandwich by which I ask them to convert to a salad.  The chicken curry salad was flavorful, healthful, colorful and one that I enjoy. Superlative ....  The pizza are [[prodigious]] slices. When I had it [[final]] [[timeframe]] and order one, I [[arrives]] [[subordinated]] and ordered a second one. The pizza by the slice, are near thin and has a near [[sanitary]] bite to it [[however]] of the oily and heavy stuffing feel that you get from pizza chains or warehouse places. It made me feel not [[culpable]] for my health...The cooks here do a good job in making their pizzas. Pizza slices go for about $3 and most of the menu items are about $7 .  The wait to get your ordered items is about 4-5 minutes...  The inside decor is very artful for a pizza place, you have to check it out yourself if you appreciate art. The art looks like it belongs in a hip coffee shop and that is a plus for a pizza place. The place is clean and seats comfortable. There are regular tables and a comfy sofa. There are seating outside as well. Zpizza also share access to the coffee and ice cream shop next door as it is under the same management. You can choose to sit in either shop..  The near midtown location makes it a ideal spot for business lunch or convenient spot. Parking is sufficient... I highly recommend this place if you need to grab a cheap and simple yet tasteful bite by yourself or plan to eat with friends and lounge afterwards at the next door coffee shop. The folks who work here are also friendly. And you can order take out too...

i adore this film as much as any one adores viewing whatever it was they saw when they were young. it was one of those films that Home Box Office showed every other day throughout my youth. this [[travesty]] is forever lodged in my brain. For someone who didn't grow up around this film, you may have become spoiled by the ADD cycle we've been in since the mid-90's and may find it more difficult to appreciate this gem. cool this is, as my sis was doped up on "better off dead" before i saw this (of which i raped & loved)-and no one, NO ONE can deny the embrace of awkward teenage humor in American cinema in the 80's - this gave birth to everything we have found tiresome in teen comedies..because with all the overuse of slow-mo, the current soundtrack, the new tech. I wonder if cinema will go back to these roots... THIS IS the teen comedy...YES!

I [[destined]] 2 dishes.  Green Curry Chicken - [[consummated]] [[buena]], quality of food was good.  overall good, but i didn't like how expensive it was.  maybe its because there aren't many thai restaurants that they can charge a lot, but i've had [[greatly]] [[preferably]] elsewhere for much cheaper.  Basil Beef - I've never had basil beef that was served with ground beefuck  I usually get pieces/slices of beef, but this place served it with ground beef.  after i realized it was ground beef, i had only a little bit since it didn't taste all that good.  advice: don't order beef dishes, go with the chicken.

I had watched this as a kid but, not being much of a Jerry Lewis fan, I had completely forgotten it (not that it's in any way memorable). The film revolves around impersonation (which seems to be in the curriculum of every comic star!) - in this case a German officer - and, while not as bad as Leonard Maltin claims (awarding it a BOMB rating), it's not exactly classic stuff either - certainly leagues behind Chaplin's THE GREAT DICTATOR (1940), even if comparably narcissistic! Ironically, the scenes prior to the appearance of the would-be wacky General offer more felicities than the rather forced humor at Nazi expense!   The film was really Lewis' last gasp during his heyday; in fact, this proved to be his [[latest]] vehicle to be released for 10 years (it's painfully apparent here that his particular brand of foolishness wouldn't pass muster in the age of Mel Brooks and Woody Allen)!

On the heels of the well received and beloved coming of age film classic ,concerning the lives of teenagers as they headed into adulthood, George Lucas' American Graffiti, we have Cooley High. An adaptation of sorts by one Eric Monte, co creator of the popular 1970's CBS sitcom Good Times.  Cooley High was, and is, viewed as a black version of American Graffiti.Instead of central California ,as in American Graffiti, we have the black slum of Chicago's Cabrini Green as the backdrop for the story here. Instead of America in 1962 Cooley High is situated in 1964.The movie stars Welcome Back Kotter's ,Lawrence Hilton Jacobs and Glynn Turman as the movie main protagonists and its' main characters. It has Garrett Morris playing the principal who tries to keep Jacobs' and Turman's characters,named Coceise and Preach, out of trouble a great deal of the time.  You know, I would like to say that Cooley High is a [[little]] comparison piece to American Graffiti or that it is a [[poor]] film on its' own but I can't. The problem lies with the fact that the producers of the film couldn't or wouldn't hide the sad underside of black life in America.Having the film in the Cabrini Green part of Chicago doesn't help things.  Neither does the crass gross attempts at humor here. When Coceise is looking for a letter of intent from a college he finds his little brother has thrown down a toilet. When the gang visits the Chicago Zoo, one of the gang named Pooter, has manure thrown on him by an ape. When the Turman's character,Preach, is being chased by two hoodlums in the school hangout(A dirty and depressing place to eat food in much less meet people at), he opens the door of the girls' bathroom while a girl is relieving herself as he escapes through the window of the same bathroom! The high school, the homes of the characters, the bathrooms, just about everywhere in the film displays the unfortunate look of urban decay and poverty.  If that wasn't enough there was the rough display of humor in the film. The use of violence and profanity in the film. Cooley High may be an coming of age film ,but it is a hard and rough coming of age film with little or none of the wit and liking of the use of nostalgia that made people like and appreciate American Graffiti so much.  Motown Records had a hand in making the film. The company's music was part of the film's soundtrack. But even here you get a sense of same old same old as one has heard these songs before a million times over. Not that they weren't great songs within themselves but black music,of that time period was more than just Motown.Especially in Chicago. The song nearing the end of the movie, by the Spinners' G.C. Cameron, was not all that impressive. There have been better Motown ballads that have been done, by better Motown artists than Cameron without question.  The last part of the film showing where the characters went to pay homage to the film Cooley High aimed to be ,American Graffiti. It shows that Preach,an intelligent but underachieving student went to Hollywood and became a successful television writer. Eric Monte may have patterned himself as Turman's character. The last shot of film show's Preach running away from Coceise's funeral ,held on a dark rainy afternoon, and all the bleakness that Cooley High came to represent. Eric Monte ,through Preach and that final scene, had one little lesson for all of us when watching Cooley High and for the love of the past. Don't look back.

First off, I'm not a firefighter, but I'm in some kind of para-firefighting unit (the guys who get called if an earthquake hits and the real firefighters need more people for SAR), so I had some training and simulation but I have no real-life experience.  But still, there are some points one notices as totally unbelievable. I can understand that they removed the mouth/nose-pieces of the masks and that there is not enough smoke, because the public would otherwise see nothing. But some things defy logic:   - No second mask attached to the oxygen. How the hell do you want to rescue people trough the smoke without one?   - Rappelling people. No, it's not done like that. I'd be screaming too if somebody hitched a rope around me in that fashion and hung me from a building. If I could scream, that is, and not pass out from want of air because the rope squeezes my lungs. The second time when they're abseiling Jack it's better but still weird.  - "Aim high". No, you [[gorram]] don't. You always [[fights]] [[fuego]] from as [[minimal]] as possible. You don't [[strife]] want to sprinkle flames, you'll want to extinguish the fire, and that's below the flames.  - No discipline. They're running around like chicken. And they shout all the time, instead of using radio, and keeping discipline.  - No tactics. Why don't they work in teams of at least two? You still can get separated, but it takes much more than if everyone just scurries around alone in search for victims.  - Do they really enter buildings without bringing water? I Europe, firefighters would never enter a burning building without.  - Firefighters on the roof. WTF do they think they're doing there without security lines or water? - Exploding rooms. Wood and brick does not "explode suddenly".  The better points are actually camaraderie and the other non-firefighting parts of the movie. It's a lot of kitsch, but that's alright. I'll give it a point for this.

OK...So I [[actually]] gave this place 5 stars which says there is no place to go, but Walker furniture. I still think the experience of buying furniture was great there. For the most part, I love my furniture. I did research the quality of the sofa and loveseat that we bought and I still believe that was the right purchase for us. On the other hand...the recliner chair that we bought has been a problem. I didn't sit in it until after it was a month old...crazy me... When I did sit in it and reclined, the frame broke. OMG! First time sitting in it (a pricey chair) and it broke. I called Walker and they scheduled someone to come out more than one week later. I got over that. I had to stay home from work for someone to come over. What I can't get over is that they sent a person out to "check out the situation" He came in, looked at the chair, said, yes you have a broken frame and I'll have to call it in. They will schedule someone to come out and pick up the chair to take it back in for repair. So you ask...What am I upset about? So, so many things...#1 The person that comes to "check out the situation" should be prepared to take the furniture with them at that time. #2. I don't want a repaired chair which the frame was broken. #3. Now I"m going to have to take off work for someone to pick up the chair and take off work for them to return it. As I'm thinking about it and getting angry all over again, I'm going to be forced to give them 1 star instead of the three that I was going to give. (keep in mind that I originally gave them 5 stars)...They don't give you an option to say morning, afternoon or evening. They just give you a 2 hour window of when they will be there. I'm sure most of the people that shop there are working class citizens. Do they think people can take a total of four days off of work (original delivery + 3 days for repair) for something that was not the customer's fault. Well, I take that back...It was my fault. If I hadn't sat in the darn chair, it would not have broken...So, to make a long story short...Walker furniture will not be getting my NEW business EVER again. Actually, they owe me my vacation days that I have to use for buying a piece of "suspect" furniture.

The Black Castle is [[two]] of those film's that has found its way into a Boris [[s]] collection and is mistakenly expected to be an [[interesting]] horror movie. [[provided]] some horror elements exist [[under]] Nathan Juran's [[filmmaking]], this really is a multi genre piece [[looking]] tightly produced and effectively portrayed. Joining Karloff, in what is a small but [[effective]] role, are Richard Greene, Stephen McNally, Lon [[mcdowell]] Jr, Rita Corday, John Hoyt & Michael Pate. [[nothing]] produced, [[actually]], out of Universal International Pictures. [[this]] plot [[having]] Greene's English gentleman travel to the castle [[manor]] of the sinister Count von Bruno {McNally}. He's [[doing]] an [[inquiry]] into the disappearance of two friends, an investigation that is [[heavy]] with danger and surprise at every turn.  This has everything that fans of the old dark [[vampire]]/castle sub-genre [[would]] wish for. Genuine good and bad guys, a [[dark]] maiden, [[shadowy]] corners for doing [[great]] deeds, devilish traps, ticking clock finale and we [[never]] [[make]] a good old fashioned bit of swashbuckling into the bargain. [[a]] cast are all turning in effective performances, particularly Greene and the [[coldly]] sneering McNally. Whilst Jerry [[s]] writing is lean and devoid of the pointless filler that has so often bogged down similar film's of this ilk. A very recommended film on proviso that Karloff fans understand it's not really a Karloff movie, and perhaps more importantly, that horror fans don't expect blood letting to be the order of the day. A fine atmospheric story with a sense of dread throughout, The Black Castle is a fine viewing experience. 7/10

Before I had seen this film, I had heard some negative comments about it. However, when watching it I found myself thinking "ok, it's a little slow-paced but this is quite interesting". As it built toward the end, it created a complex moral dilemma, leading to a shocking yet, within the context of the film, entirely believable decision with extremely powerful dramatic consequences. If this had been followed through, it would have been a tremendously powerful ending and would have given me a very favourable impression of the film.  However, due to an ending which not only cops out emotionally, tacking on an unnecessary happy-ish ending without real emotional credibility but also within the context of the film makes absolutely no [[offence]] whatsoever for you clearly see one of the character take an action which should end her life but inexplicably doesn't. Incidentally, please tell me if I did miss something here and there is a reason why she survives as I just couldn't how logically she could have and this wrecked the whole [[movie]] for me.  This said, all [[3]] leads [[shine]] in powerful performances although Kevin McKidd's characters' transformation by the end [[go]] a little further than is fully convincing and it does [[build]] a very powerful ethical triangle.  This film is recommended if you ready yourself to walk out when the mother and the sister are lying on the bed. But do not watch further than this unless you have only a pinch, but several mountains, of salt.

My Name is Earl(2005)   Review:......[[At]] I have seen this.  This is something else. First off, how is this rated so high? I cannot understand that. This "show" is filled to the [[greatest]] with either annoying people, stupid people, or just plain unlikeable. The "gags" are [[infamous]].  [[me]] [[encountered]] one episode where the wife of Earl's brother wrapped and washed herself with dead fish. Not kidding. That wasn't funny, that's repulsive. Then she and Earl's extremely stupid brother(and I mean stupid) then had sex. I nearly threw up.  This has to [[fi]] one of the most desperate [[quest]] at comedy in a [[lasting]] time. Jason [[Reads]] is a [[artists]] actor, but is trapped in a helpless [[trait]] in this [[scary]] "[[irreverent]]".  [[Comte]] is now in jail for this current season. Let's hope he gets the chair just so this show gets put out of it's misery.  The Last Word: This show would be [[satirical]] to people who think Larry the Cable guy is funny. To the rest of the world, NOT A CHANCE. Avoid like the [[plagues]].

I've always found the dilettante Man Ray and his artistic efforts to be deeply pretentious, and I've never understood why his work attracts so much attention. Apart from his Rayographs (which he invented by accident, and which are merely direct-contact photo prints), his one real contribution to culture seems to be that he was the first photographer to depict female nudity in a manner that was accepted as art rather than as porn. [[Although]] surely this had to happen eventually, and there's no real reason why Ray deserves the credit. The critical reaction to Man Ray reminds me of the story about the Emperor's New Clothes.  "L'Étoile de merde" ... whoops, "de mer" ... features a lot of blurry photography and a recurring visual theme of a starfish, which is never explained. Starfishes have the fascinating ability to regenerate lost limbs -- and even to regenerate entire duplicate bodies -- but, if that has anything to do with this movie's theme, Ray neglects to say so. I was much more impressed by this movie's title cards, which (in French) manage to include rhymes, a pun ('Si belle, Cybele') and some portmanteaux.  As so often in Ray's work, there is indeed a beautiful young woman seen in this movie. Unfortunately, the photography is (largely) so blurred that we have little opportunity to appreciate her. I'll rate this mess one point out of 10.

Well, okay, maybe not [[irreproachable]], but it was pretty close. This movie jumped from crime drama to romantic goofball comedy and back again so quickly all the way throughout that it seemed like two different movies that played simultaneously and then joined up again at the end. But they did it smoothly, and some in the theater found the bloody parts (like the scalping scene) to be funny as well. I just about threw up, but I guess that's just me. Greg Kinear is [[irreproachable]] as a soap opera actor. He has the ability to perform those over-dramatic soap scenes with just the right facial expressions and voice intonations. His scenes with Betty seem like something out of "Sleepless in Seattle" or some other romantic comedy like that. You almost forget that Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock are searching Betty down. Morgan Freeman's fascination with Betty was rather creepy, considering that he could practically be her grandfather, but the scenes where he is conversing with her photograph are definitely worth a few laughs! Chris Rock's performance seems rather [[forestier]], but he has his moments. Renee Zellweger is so [[tasty]] as [[Klein]], the [[pleasurable]] waitress with the crude, [[unbeliever]] husband who treats her like dirt. It's very unlikely that she would have actually gotten a job at a hospital without any real credentials, but, hey, it's a movie, just go along with it! Her roommate, Rosa, shines as well, as a woman who cares about Betty, but doesn't quite know how to deal with Betty's sickness. And, lastly, there is Crispin Glover. As a fan of his, I, naturally, thought that the movie could have been funnier had he been in it more. No one else has the same style of acting that Crispin has, and the argument between Chris Rock, Crispin, and the sheriff about the soap opera is hilarious. I guess I'm saying that I liked this movie quite a bit! If you can stomach blood, violence, and a lot of foul language, it's worth the watch and will give you plenty of laughs!

I wanted this [[hiatus]] to work out. One of my Boyfriend's co-worker's John, RANTS about this place. I've read their menu about 6 times in the past year. We came here one time last year & ended up walking away because the NIGHT STAFF don't seem to care too kindly about customer service. They just rude, "What do you want?". My boyfriend & turned right back around & told the guy "I'm all set".  If that wasn't our FIRST bad sign.  Last night at 9pm, (wasn't busy) we tried it & when we should have turned right back around. Same thing again. "Yo, what can I get ya?", it was better than the last time. LOL we ordered two philly's. The guy took the time to ask me if I wanted onion. I said no onion PLEASE. Now I'm standing there reading the big sign in English, about how they PRIDE themselves on accuracy . Also make sure you get the receipt or the meal is on them! (cool!!!)  I'm thinking "WOW, they know to please their customers."   At this point I'm trying to find a clean table, okay so I wipe down a table myself with my lemon scented hand wipes... I'm dying from the aroma coming from the kitchen.  FOOD TIME - The meat was DRY, it tasted like I was eating STEAKUMS ( ew ?!), with a hint of seasoning. VERY bland & dreadful food. Mine came with hardly any prov. cheese, I had ONION & mushrooms weren't cooked! I thought they would of sauteed the mushrooms at the very least on the grill. A philly is supposed to be juicy, flavorful & and most of all LOADED.  Even after the bad first expereince, I gave you the benefit of the doubt guy! I tipped & I still ended up feeling like I'm the bad guy. How does that work?  I'm putting my foot down, this place deserves a one star rating. I hope the Owner reads these reviews..

Given the proximity to other very similar restaurants on this block, pick the other restaurants over this one.  Owned by the kids of Kabul (across the street), Maza is just a mediocre version of Kabul and only $1-3 cheaper.  The service was [[monstrous]] (though I went only a month or two after it opened, so that may have improved), they charge for a very small amount of bread, which is a bummer when you have a larger group of people, and the food is pretty average.  If you are in the mood for this kind of food, go across the street to Kabul where the food is reliably very delicious.

I know it's rather unfair to comment on a movie without seeing the complete piece - but I am going to anyway! I waited for a laugh, I tried to give it time. I think 20 minutes is long enough to wait in a comedy for a laugh. My [[hilarious]] never came, so I [[awarded]] up.  It's [[farcical]] humour, not so stupid that you have to laugh, though. It isn't anywhere near that high grade. Let me correct that, it's just *stupid* - not stupid humour. They may have intended for certain scenes to be funny, but they weren't. [[me]] suppose, if you were really bored you could somehow blend the movie with a hallucination and end up with a mildly entertaining experience.  A very [[sorrowful]] [[works]].

This was my first look at this short-lived British TV horror series, but I had seen a couple of Hammer horror films (Horror of Dracula, Captain Kronos: Vampire Hunter) and thought highly-enough of them to give this a look.  This first episode was a shocker - not for the [[monstrosity]] but for all the nudity. Was this "regular" TV in England in 1980? If so, it showed a lot more skin than what we see in North America. There were three separate scenes showing naked women and their breasts, one scene where a guy put his hand on one, and another scene with man a top of a woman faking intercourse. Hey, I'm not complaining.   The story is a simple one: a witch who had disappeared in the 17th century comes back to her old house and makes life tough for the married man. The latter, Jon Finch as "David Winter," wasn't much of an actor, but his wife wasn't bad and was a really beauty. She was be Prunella Gee as "Mary." The husband suspected her, rightly so, of having an affair and that plays a part in this story.  Patricia Quinn was entertaining as the laughing witch "Lucinda Jessup," who comes back with a mean streak in her and has a good time tormenting the couple until things go wrong at the end. As a man, I'd say it was particular fun to see the two women going at it! This starts off slowly but once "Lucinda" starts stirring up things, it gets very entertaining.

[[was]] never really enjoyed buffets, but my wife wanted to come here for her birthday. I [[usually]] really felt like I could get a good meal at a buffet but I was wrong.   The sushi was [[never]] [[great]]. They had at least 10 different rolls and not just the basic rolls but stuff like Rainbow rolls and the likes. Tried them all and they were all very good. They had one sushi chief just throwing out rolls cause the sushi was going fast. They also had tempura which included lots of vegetables plus shrimp.   They had a meat bar with prime rib, Chinese BBQ ribs, & sausage. The ribs are really good. Nice and sweet. You have to try these ribs.The sausage is ok and didn't try the prime rib but looked good. Lots of good Chinese food with lots of seafood in it and I enjoyed it. There was also a cold bar with salads and fresh fruit. Lastly, they have a [[really]] [[bad]] desert bar where they have a server scoop out the ice cream.   So [[second]], they have lots of selections of [[various]] [[amounts]] of food but most important it's all fresh. [[it]] [[becomes]] tell that none of the dishes have been sitting out there for a long [[ages]]. [[been]] fresh and hot.   Service was good. Picking up our dirty dishes and filling up our water glasses in a timely manner. All I can say is that the food is really good, lots of variety to satisfy everybody, but the best part is that if you Check-in you get a 20% off your bill.   Enjoy and have a really good meal.

The undoubted highlight of this movie is Peter O'Toole's performance. In turn wildly comical and [[hideously]] terribly tragic. Does anybody do it better than O'Toole? I don't think so. What a great face that man has!  The story is an odd one and quite disturbing and emotionally intense in parts (especially toward the end) but it is also oddly touching and does succeed on many levels. However, I felt the film basically revolved around Peter O'Toole's luminous performance and I'm sure I wouldn't have enjoyed it even half as much if he hadn't been in it.

I've read a lot of reviews about Showtime on IMDb and many seem to miss the mark. I've noticed a lot of reviewers calling this the typical "buddy" film. De Niro is in no way Murphy's buddy throughout most of this movie. In fact, part of the [[travesty]] of this film is De Niro's reluctance to be friends with anybody.  Murphy really shines in this one. He is back at doing what he does best, acting like a complete ham. He is a cop who wants so much to be an actor and enjoys being in the reality show. De Niro is perfect as the straight man who thinks the entire thing is stupid. I thought the two of them had great chemistry and were a perfect casting choice. Rene Russo is also great as the TV producer. Of course, she loves everything Murphy does and tries so hard (along with Murhpy) to get DeNiro going too.  A lot of reviewers have touched on the hilarious scene with William Shatner, reprising his role as TJ Hooker to train Murhpy & De Niro how to "act" like cops. But, my favorite scene involves Murphy in the "confessional" hoping he could get a Wesly Snipes-Like cop to team up with instead of De Niro. Man, that was hilarious! Comedies often depend on your personal tastes. Sure you could poke holes in the plot, most often you can with a comedy. I was psyched to see the pairing of Murphy and De Niro...I think it brought out the best in Murphy, which was nice to see him at the top of his game again. I can only imagine it was a great honor for Murphy to be paired with the great De Niro. Rating 8 of 10 stars.

Everything they have is already premade and nothing is fresh. GROSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  The steak was bland and I pretty much used an entire mound of salt for flavor.

KUNG FU KICKED TO [[10]] STARS     Kung Fu Restaurant broke an important rule. That rule is to NEVER EVER force your customers to leave a minute after giving them the check. Breaking this rule has consequences such as A ONE STAR REDUCTION IN A REVIEW RATING. As a result of their unprofessional action a 3.4 rating is dropped to 2.4 stars that is rounded off to [[four]] stars. Yikes! kind of how my brother and I also felt. In all honesty this a gentle response considering that many talented Yelper's would reward this experience with a one star rating.     Kung Fu Restaurant is located in the Las Vegas Chinatown District at the southwest corner of Valley View and Spring Mountain Boulevard. After a day in Springs Preserve suffering with a hurt left foot my brother and I decided to drive a few traffic lights South on Valley View Boulevard to Chinatown. This would be a convenient choice. Actually not really. Regardless that Kung Fu is at a major crossroads, the parking situation is atrocious. The diminutive parking spaces are more ideal for a golf cart than today's modern vehicles. I'd sacrifice my car if I left it there. So, we parked across Valley View Boulevard near Starbuck's with the intention of a post dinner coffee after. So I'd sacrifice my legs and limbs crossing a busy Valley View Boulevard.    The service started out allright. Immediately after walking inside there was a booth available (I wonder why). The waiter presented my brother and I with glasses of cold water and the menus.     Regardless that there was a large assortment of dishes to choose from, only the entree page dishes included jasmine rice. Nothing about brown or fried rice. I ordered the shrimp chop suey which was around $9.50. My taste buds say that the shrimp chop suey is 3.4 stars. In comparison to the Chinese restaurants that I have reviewed (my Chinese Restaurants list is the home of these reviews) the size of the shrimps trailed in comparison. Generally speaking, or tasting the quality from the vegetables to the sauce tasted fine. The soy sauce gave some taste to the jasmine rice.  With the shrimp chop suey and jasmine rice, I ordered hot tea. In my opinion it is nearly impossible to mess up the delicious hot tea that Chinese restaurants serve. After a few cups of the delicious green tea, I stand by my opinion. Thanks to the Yelp checkin offer, the tea was complimentary. I would of enjoyed a bowl of my beloved wonton soup,  one of my favorite foods in the world going back to my toddlerhood. But Kung Fu doesn't give any breaks with the soup. The war won ton soup is around $9. they ought to include personal portions of soup on the menu. Then again, they ought to include chopsticks on the table.     The food was good. I ate everything down to the plate including the sauce. My brother and I were talking at the time the waiter presented us with the check. Around a minute later the waiter tells us to pay because people were waiting for the booth. He wasn't giving us the stink eye and handed us our fortune cookies. Without a nasty demeanor he just rushing us out of the booth barely giving my brother and I time to split the bill.     I didn't read the fortune cookie. An appropriate fortune cookie would say something like, "The average person tells nine other people when they are unhappy with a business where the average Yelper tells a couple thousand people when they are unhappy with a business." Or the fortune cookie might of said, "You have a World of restaurants to choose from in your city." Or the fortune cookie could of said, "There is nothing like competition." To close off this review, what I am saying is that Kung Fu rushed us out the door of their restaurant and it is a door I don't intend to open in a long time.

Komodo vs. Cobra is not going to set the world on fire. It's not a hallmark of [[film]] history. What it is is a group of underfunded filmmakers trying to make another movie, make another [[payments]], and continue to support themselves and their families. As such I give these efforts a lot of slack. I mean, come on, it has to be hard to be a Russian special effects technician. Not a lot of big budget films getting made there. BUT-- they are a dedicated bunch and more than willing to throw their all into whatever [[nil]] American monster flick [[owe]] affordable SFX. And I get a kick out of looking for the same locations appear time and again in these flicks. If for some reason you find yourself watching this again, look at the sequence where Pare and company are walking through a "jungle." Look at their feet and you'll see paved walkways. And if you happen to still have a copy of "AI Assault" (shown a week or two earlier also on SciFi), you'll see the folks in there tramping through the same ersatz jungle. Come to think of it, I think the helicopters land in the same clearing in both flicks. I can admire the thriftiness of these films. Every dollar really does show up on the screen! Too bad there just aren't enough dollars......

The year 2004 was the year of the biopic with no [[better]] than four pictures tackling real events, real people, with varying degrees of critical praise. Of the four pictures to make it to the race to the Oscars in early 2005 (KINSEY, THE AVIATOR, HOTEL RWANDA, and, RAY), RAY became the big winner of the night as the acting award went to Jamie Foxx for his portrayal of R & B genius Ray Charles.  And it was [[such]] despite that Leonardo diCaprio came close and Liam Neeson wasn't even nominated. What made Foxx the winner was that the other two were playing relatively obscure eccentrics, Ray Charles was still making music right up until his death in 2004 and by then there wasn't a soul who didn't know at least one song that Charles' had penned. It did help that Jamie Foxx rose well above the movie -- itself as a whole [[so]] weak and often looking like it wouldn't be out of place as a TV biopic -- and his portrayal is detailed as it's ferocious. He has the delicate assignment which is to embody a person down to nuances, and once the crisis of Ray's addiction to heroin hits a head, Foxx pulls out all the stops and it isn't hard to imagine the real Ray actually going through such a painful ordeal.  The low point of the film is how it spends a little too much time in detailing Ray's relationship with women. Like THE AVIATOR, Taylor Hackford wishes to establish that Ray had this turbulent life, a product of his own demons and his entry into success at a time when being black and successful brought a huge amount of baggage. Of the women, the only one to succeed bringing real life is Sharen Warren as Ray's mother. Hers is a difficult role since she is alone on screen with the child actor playing young Ray but her facial and body language is gut-wrenching, especially at the moment she must relinquish her maternity to have Ray find his way around the house. Such intensity of emotion, to stand there and watch your blind son crawl across a room and having to force him to have this rude awakening into independence. A beautiful performance, and one which should have been acknowledged.  A fantastic counterpoint to RAY is the featured music. Anyone who knows R & B will enjoy the early recordings of Ray's radio hits as much as his later ones which would bring him to the forefront of popular music, and Jamie Foxx virtually steals the show as he performs the songs as Ray. That alone will live on even when the movie in itself is little more than a stiff biopic. I would have, though, loved it if they would have used his last Adult Contemporary hit from 1993, "Sing my Song for You" in the closing credits. After all, it is Ray Charles, a performer who had a fierce dedication to his art.
one of [jaglom's] better efforts -- a [[sardonic]] and sometime bitter movie about love .
An apt description by Spock of an all-powerful fop into whose clutches fall the crew of the Enterprise. This was one sector of space our starship should have avoided: first Sulu & Kirk simply disappear off the bridge; a landing party follows them to the surface of an unknown planet and encounter [[rann]], a seemingly aristocratic man dressed in attire from an Earth of many centuries past. But he demonstrates abilities of someone or something far beyond human and doesn't register on McCoy's medical tricorder. The officers manage to escape back to the ship but, like some bad cosmic penny, Trelane keeps popping up. He brings them all back, including some female companionship, to continue his games. The dilemma now [[relies]] on elements of 'The Most Dangerous [[game]] out in space and there's an exasperating, even infuriating aspect to the crew's utter helplessness before such unbridled power.  What really makes this a [[bizarre]] episode is the memorable performance by guest star Campbell as the overpowering but not all-knowing alien. His character is obviously an early version of Q, who was introduced 20 years later in the pilot for the TNG series. Trelane's confrontation scene with Spock stands out among all the strange drama which unfolds. As usual, Kirk quickly begins to look for possible weaknesses in his new nemesis, despite being quite outmatched. The answers to exactly what or who Trelane is are right in front of us the whole time so, when we do learn the truth, it makes complete sense in view of Campbell's pitch-perfect acting. He indulges himself constantly, preening before some unknown audience, remarking on things with a flair which is infectious but not quite right - we can't quite pin it down at first, but there's something missing here. Every few minutes, his tone becomes sinister and the crew now appears to be in serious danger. In a way, you can't take your eyes off him, always waiting to see what he does next. Actor John de Lancie captured that similar tone as Q on the Next Generation series.

There were at least a half dozen silent-film versions of Shakespeare's "The Merchant of Venice," and there have been several television productions. But no one has ever gotten around to making a big-budget theatrical feature from the play . . . until now. Given the nature of the play/s most memorable character, Shylock the Nasty Jew, it's a good guess that the little unpleasantness that transpired in Europe in the late 1930's and 1940's may have dampened filmmakers' enthusiasm. Sure the main motivation for Michael [[Emerson]] new film is to provide Al Pacino with a chance to shout, bray, brood, mutter, and be tormented - all of which he is quite good at. Like Richard III, the role of Shylock is a scenery-chewer's dream. It is ridiculous to call Shakespeare an anti-Semite, since he never met a Jew. Jews were banned from England from 300 years before his time to some decades after his death; and its unlikely that he ever traveled abroad. On some level, Jews might as well have been a mythological race to him. But, while Shakespeare may not have been anti-Semitic, his play certainly is. Pacino gives Shylock a strange accent that is probably meant to suggest the slightest hint of Yiddish. Unfortunately, the result is a 16th-century moneylender with the unmistakable diction and cadences of Fozzie Bear. Radford's version begins with a crawl about the wretched teratment of Jews and then spot Antonio (Jeremy Irons) gratuitiously spitting on Shylock (Pacino), who's really just standing around, minding his own business. Will buy it when it comes out on DVD, for sure! Sarge Booker

Any time I go Las Vegas and want to stay on the Strip, Harrah's is the hotel [[me]] [[elected]].  The location of Harrah's is excellent-right in the middle of the Strip. The rooms are nice, clean, comfortable and the price is [[awfully]] [[justified]].  Harrah's is not too [[great]], so you don't have to walk a mile to get out of the hotel. Around the hotel there are tons of places to eat inexpensively. For the room choice, I often ask for the one in Carnival Tower which is away from the noisy Carnival Court.  All deluxed rooms are renovated, so they are all [[alright]]. I used to stay in Madi Gras Tower a few times, no problem with the noise either, but some said it's noisy. Anyway the rooms in Madi Gras Tower are a bit smaller then those in Carnival Tower. If you're not looking for a very luxurious hotel, just a hotel with good clean comfortable room and lively atmosphere, then I think you won't be [[unimpressed]] with Harrah's.

"The [[Twin]] Effect" is the [[finest]] movie I've [[enjoyed]]! Not only is the support weak, but the [[personage]] as well. I'm sorry to say to you Edison fans, but Kazaf is by far the weakest Vampire I've seen in my life. I'm sorry Edison; your role in this movie was disappointing. Edison does not fight whatsoever in this movie and I'm sure if they didn't have Kazaf in the movie, the plot wouldn't be much different. The main plot in the movie is not explained nearly enough and the entire movie focused too much on Helen and Kazaf's growing relationship. I mean, who the hell was Kazaf and why did they need his blood? Yeah, he's the prince right? So what!  Certain scenes in this movie were just plain stupid. Yeah, the action was [[excellent]] but the entire outline of it was stupid. In one scene towards the end, Duke Dekotes says that Kazaf is the strongest of his brothers... yeah it would seem so now that he's full grown. Why would you wait until he's grown up to attack? Another scene was with Jackie Chan, one of my personal favorites. In the scene, Jackie asked Helen who were the creatures that persistently followed them. How can you be so naive as to not know that they are vampires? People are dying around them with bite marks on their necks; surely the NEWS would be on it faster than you can say "Vampire."  The characters were yet another mistake in the movie. Helen, played by Charlene Choi, is the girlfriend of Kazaf. What kind of girl would not be scared of Vampires, especially if it is your brother's job to kill them? I can bet you that you would not find such a brave girl as Helen if you searched your whole life. Helen is annoying, bitchy, and is a total drama queen in the movie. She tries too hard to be different and in the end fails miserably. One of the weirdest and most disturbing characters I've seen in any movie. Why would you bite someone's neck especially if you're not a vampire? It's very odd that her reaction to Kazaf's confession doesn't turn him off. Kazaf, played by Edison Chen, is another stupid character in the story. How degrading for a young actor as himself to play in a movie with such a poorly constructed role. He does not stand up for himself throughout the movie and does not fight. Although I'm a fan of Edison, I wouldn't want a man who lies on the ground the whole time. Gypsy and Reeve are my favorite characters in the movie. Their love is pure and sweet. Gypsy is gorgeous and does not try too hard like Helen. Reeve, played by Ekin Cheng, is wise and seems to be the only person that makes sense in the movie. A plot failure was the death of Reeve. The movie had absolutely no substance yet it doomed itself by removing one of the only likable characters. Another character was Duke Dekotes. The story didn't focus much on him and therefore made his desire to obtain Kazaf's "rock" seem irrelevant.  It's very sad because towards the end of the movie, I was forcing myself to watch because I so desperately wanted to see Kazaf fight. The end was so abrupt because the whole time I was expecting so great to happen. Kazaf, who's the supposed Vampire Prince, does nothing for the movie and I'm sure if he were taken out, the movie wouldn't be much different. I highly recommend you to NOT waste your time on this movie as I have. I was greatly disappointed. If you're in search of a great movie, why not watch "Lord of the Rings" or "Pirates of the Caribbean?" Likeable characters with a well-written plot.
I remember seeing this [[moviemaking]] in the theater in 1984 when I was 6 years-old (you do the math). I absolutely loved it. [[me]] was Tarzan for the 2 [[weekend]] after seeing it (climbing the furniture, jumping around making monkey sounds). It started a fascination with Tarzan and monkeys, but oddly enough a longer [[persistent]] love for Christopher Lambert (keep in mind that I saw Highlander [[immensely]] [[terse]] after this). 1984 was the [[eventual]] time I saw that film, until about a month ago. It happened to [[ai]] on [[cables]] as I was getting ready for bed at 3:30 am and even though it was late and I was tired and I had to be at [[job]] at 9:00 am, I [[halted]] up to watch this [[moviemaking]] that I [[amar]] as a kid.   Upon [[spectacle]] it [[me]] realized that it was not that great of a film and even odder then that, that Andie MacDowell's [[audio]] was dubbed by someone else. Ian Holme was of course solid as usual, and surprisingly the monkey [[coveralls]] [[ever]] kind of held up, but what was most [[unbelievable]] was how good Lambert was as Tarzan. He was great! The depth he managed to capture in so few [[runways]], his primal body language and most [[drastically]] his ability to bring this character through its extremely large ark, were just amazing.  As I stated earlier I am Lambert fan, but I'm used to Highlander, The Hunted and Fortress. In this film he was really quite good and it is a shame that he never got a chance to portray a character with such depth again.  So to make a short story way too long, I was a little disappointed that the film was not that good, but I was glad to see that Lambert was good and I do not regret staying up until 6:00am to see it.

Just opposite Cineworld in Fountainbridge, Wing Sing Inn provides a truly Chinese experience, in sometimes amusing ways.  Their menu, for example, features [[interesting]] items such "Water Swamp Morning - glory in Malaysian style" and "Salt & Pepper Fog Leg," and when we phoned to place our order, they answered initially in Chinese, and even when persuaded to speak English had a brusque manner that made no concession to conventional notions of customer service.  Nevertheless, this did not [[benefit]] from our enjoyment of the food they delivered.  Me and my friends steered away from the more, umm, unusual sounding dishes and stuck with things like Pak Choi with Mushrooms and Yu-Hung Aubergine which were excellent and came with delightful garnishes.  The many Chinese customers who frequent this restaurant bear witness to the fact that Wing Sing Inn, despite its cheesy name, is the real deal for authentic Asian cooking.

I rented this movie without having heard (or read) anything about it. What a shame! This [[travesty]] is intelligent, witty, hilarious, fast-paced, and realistically ridiculous. The characters manage to get developed without relying too heavily on clichéd, tired stereotypes. It was refreshing to watch. I couldn't help thinking that marketing would have helped lob this not-so-mainstream movie into the starved-for-intelligent-comedy mainstream. The quality of the dialogue and the ease with which the actors execute a huge range of awkwardness, heartbreak and comedy is so rare these days--I felt that the actors must have really enjoyed participating in something this rich. How is it that National Treasure was number one at the box office for three weeks in a row--it is so weak in too many ways to mention. I guess I'm just happy that movies like "Seeing.." are still being made somewhere out there.

Let me start off by saying, I usually cut my own hair. My tastes are simple and easy to accomplish on my own. That being said, I decided to step out of my comfort zone a little and have someone else do my hair. I had heard from a few friends at the gym that this place is the absolute best place to get your hair cut, if you want a little style in your life. I decided to give it a go, and let me tell you, I am not [[spectacular]]. When I first arrived, I had to wait almost an hour before I was even acknowledged, then another 30 minutes before I was actually seated to do the deed. I don't know the guy's name who cut my hair but I know for a fact that it was not Elliot. The guy i guess just did not pay attention because all I asked was for about 3 inches off and to make it look a little messy. I guess that was too hard, because I wound up with a [[ravages]]. At the shop it looked fine in the mirror. When I got home though, my bros were a little [[fearful]] because my hair looked lopsided. Sure enough, [[me]] go check the three wall mirror I have, and it [[BE]] [[BIASED]]. Not only was the thickness on the left about twice what was on the right, but the right was about an inch shorter. I was so embarrassed. I guess in the long run it turned out okay because I wound up cutting all my hair off which is a new look for me, and i like it. The downside is that i am out 75 bucks, and I had to cut my hair myself. Not cool.

I live about 20 minutes drive away and did not feel like going all the [[road]] back out just for two items, and in addition to the [[road]] and gas cost, I am also handicapped and it is difficult for me to get out and [[wait]]. I called the location and explained the [[situation]] to the person on the phone who stated they were the manager, who apologized and asked if I could come back to have the items remade. I explained that it was a 20 minute drive each way and I was handicapped and would prefer not to have to go back out that late at night. The manager said no problem and told me they would write my name down so I could have the two items replaced on my next  visit.   On Feb 13th, about a week after the initial incident, I went into the store to request my two items that were to be replaced on my next visit. After waiting for almost 10 minutes to speak to a manager, I was finally able to speak to a female manager who was clearly not the person in charge because she said she was unable to find my name in their "book" and told me I would have to speak to the general manager Jerry. I watched the woman I spoke with go back to making food, and I could see her speaking to a gentleman across the line from her, who I later found out was the general manager, Jerry. After she spoke to him and told him that I was waiting in the front to speak with him, he continued to make food for at least 7 more minutes before he decided to grace me with his presence. Meanwhile, I am standing in the front of the store, having issues because I walk with a cane and cannot stand for long. After several minutes and seeing that he clearly did not care if I was attended to or not, I had to sit down and wait because I could no longer stand.   After about 7-8 minutes (17-18 total minutes from the time I entered the store and asked to speak to a manager) Jerry finally came up to the front. I explained what happened and that the female manager was unable to find my name in their book. At that point, without even looking in the "book" himself, Jerry said, "I'm sorry, your name is not in the book so there is nothing I can do for you." I replied, "Ok, so, are you saying that you are not going to replace my items that were incorrectly made? He responded, "That's right!" I was really aggravated at this point. I had stood there and waited  almost 20 minutes for this! I said, "I am really angry that you wasted my time like this, it is the responsibility of the store to write down this information and not my fault that someone did not do their job." He replied, " If it isn't in here, then you didn't call. You could be lying just to get free food for all I know. How am I supposed to know it actually happened the way you said it did?" I WAS LIVID!!!!!!!! To make matters worse, my neighbors were standing there because they happened to be visiting the restaurant at the same time. I was furious and humiliated. I told him, "Just forget about it, I will take this up with your manager." I asked for his name and left. As I was walking out the door, I turned around to see him laughing! This is absolutely inexcusable behavior for any employee, let alone a general manager!  I went home and called to make a formal complaint about this to his district manager. I hope they do something about this man! How dare he insinuate that I would lie and make up a story to get two measly food items free when I had to drive 20 minutes each way and spend at least $10 in gas to get there! Never again. As long as this man is working at this restaurant, I will never return. I can almost guarantee you that I am not the only person he has mistreated and I won't be the last. People like that have a sense of entitlement and an attitude that berates others and empowers only his own self-inflated ego.

This place was [[accept]]. The decor is nice and the ladies lounge is super cute!   The only thing I would like to tell everyone is to pay attention to how much the bartenders charge you and how much change they give you back!  There is more than one bar. I went to the main bar and got Coconut Ciroc on the rocks and it was 14 dollars. I went to one of the smaller bars and ordered the same thing and I was charged 19 dollars.    Also, at the main bar, rather than give my friends all thier change and let them decide what to tip the bartender, he attempted to take his own tip out and give them the rest after he took his tip! This was crazy. I am not sure it was just a [[pernicious]] night.   Other than that I was there on a Saturday, the music was good and the crowd was okay. If you are not into the big clubs this place is okay not too big and not too small and you still get the club experience.

I keep meaning to ask if they do gift registries at this store.  Because my friends say I'm hard to buy for, and I just don't get it.  Go to Made.  Apply blindfold.  Spin.  Stop.  Walk forward.  Buy what you touch.  Unless it's baby clothes.  It's that easy.  I [[once]] love this place.  I make people go here.  I got a rockin' ring here.  Some cool books. Of course a few magnets.  Recent purchase was a baby t-shirt (for friend) that said angel on the front and had a pic of wings on the back.  Aw....  And the selection is often changing as artists create new things.   You should go.  You need to go.  Just go.
Graphically, it is the same game as the first one just different levels and some new features added for fun.  The PS1 version still has an issue with giving skaters enough air for some ground tricks. The Dreamcast version, which is rarely seen anymore, was the [[advisable]] version of the 4 [[version]] (Xbox eventually came out with a 5th with 2x), it had the clearer resolution and the skaters looked better and more detailed the PS1 and N64 could handle.  [[Both]] [[layer]] are really [[alarmingly]] done, from start to finish, like the first one, the school was my favorite, i enjoyed that level so much, not only for the golf cart that would sometimes run you over but for the length. That's what i liked about the first two games, they don't make these games graphically enhanced, they just focused on length of levels, which is cool.  Overall, just as good as the first one, and well worth playing.

The [[advent]] of SCREAM gave birth to a whole new horror flicks wave. I'm happy with that, as a big fan of horror, and I liked most of those new horror films. BOC is a one big pack of horror.

Came here with my boss on lunch break. [[Select]] to try this place out because not many other pizza places around this area had that great of reviews either. Working at a food place myself and my boss having owned it we know how things should be in a restaurant. The second my boss looked around she was like nope not eating here. There was pizza dough laying around open on the bottom shelf that [[scrutinized]] like it hadn't been [[anointed]] in forever. The soda machine had [[accretion]] of some liquid and was leaking at the bottom. Honestly my standards aren't too high with food and I usually have a tough stomach so [[me]] [[outlined]] what the heck I'll eat anyways since we didn't have much time.

Well yeah, there was no [[hankering]] at all.  It didn't even taste like cardboard, just like nothing.  The salsa also was very bland.  I have to say though that the guac was not bad.  So, go there to drink and to watch the 10,000 TVs they have but not for the food.

we have been to red velvet cafe many times...here are the pros and cons:  Pros:   - Great desserts (mini vegan cakes) at under 250 calories.   - Great guacamole and outstanding hummus (not on menu anymore but you can still get it).  It costs more here than the same order at the Fashion Mall location, I believe. - Never very crowded  Cons: - Pricey!  (esp. the cookies!) - Don't stay open past 8 pm - Some of the worst wait staff I've had - it is [[routinely]] bad - have had a couple of different guys and girls - both equally [[despicable]].  You will need to flag them down for a refill of tea.  Went there last night and waited 15 min before the guy came and took my order.   - Again, Pricey for what you get!  Our tab was more than $86 for dinner /tea/desserts(I had a wrap and tea and dessert) - we did not have any appetizers.  Imagine if we would have had good service, the bill would have been higher due to higher tip!  LOL! - Not many table tops that will hold 4+ people -- I think maybe 6-7 total.  We made our mind up last night, after the consistent bad service and high tab for an average meal that we won't go back there again except for desserts and that will be "to go"...  The owner/chef is there a lot - I don't know why she doesn't notice that her wait-staff is horrible and killing her business.  She also needs to lower her prices by 10-15%...She should read these reviews or at least have a suggestion box at her register...

After a humiliating experience on an airplane, Nashawn Wade (Kevin Hart) sues the airline and uses the money he wins to start up his own full-service airline. What makes his different is that it has sexy stewardesses, an on board dance club and no less than Captain Snoop Dogg in the cockpit.  Soul Plane is a very [[ethnic]] comedy except it is only occasionally [[funniest]]. Soul Plane has been described as an "urban" version of Airplane. The problem is that Soul Plane doesn't even come close to achieving the laughs of Airplane. The jokes in Soul Pane are too offensive and they are mostly unoriginal. I would be lying if I said I didn't laugh since there were some funny moments. However, I was expecting more and I [[departure]] the [[movie]] [[unimpressed]].  I would compare Soul Plane to Airplane 2. The latter was just a rehash of the first film while the former is just a rehash of outdated, crude jokes. There is really no creativity behind the movie and there are only a few fun spots. However, I don't think Soul Plane is "bottom 100" bad. Right now, the movie is ranked at number 82 and that's a little harsh. I'm not saying this is a good movie but it isn't a terrible on either. The running time is only 86 minutes long so it isn't too much of a pain to watch. For stupid comedies, you can do a lot worse.  No one in the cast is very good but they all seem to be having fun and this helps. Kevin Hart was very annoying as Nashawn. He had a few funny lines but he is a very poor leading man. Snoop Dogg, who was mildly funny in Starsky and Hutch, completely flunks here. Tom Arnold was actually tolerable and that was the film's biggest surprise. The most annoying person in the movie was Ryan Pinkston. He was not funny at all and he will never be funny. The funniest cast members were Missi Pyle and Mo'Nique. They gave the best lines and they made me laugh the most. In the end, Soul Plane may fit the bill if you're looking for a stupid comedy but it would probably be better if you just skip the film. Rating 4/10

We just picked up some jerk pork spice and some strong black peppercorns since I am a black pepper lover. It's not your McCormick spice container for sure. If that's what you want, head to Walmart. If you want to walk on the wild side for a bit, come to penzey's. And buckle up.

Every Saturday morning at 11 a.m. I watched Superstars. All the biggest events happened on this show at the time. Challenge, which aired Sunday mornings, was decent too, but all the big stuff [[seemed]] on this show. Wrestlers would do all their interviews with Mean Gene on a platform next to the live crowd or talk on their own to the screen in front of a background that promoted them. The matches were usually squashes but sometimes you would see 2 mid carders square off in the main event. There were also interview shows that usually resulted in violence thus setting up a feud. These segments ranged from Pipers Pit, The Body Shop, The Flower Shop, The Snake Pit, The Brother Love Show, The Funeral Parlor, and The Barber Shop. I don't recall any titles [[metamorphosis]] hands on this show. That usually happened at pay per views and Saturday Nights Main Event.
I saw this film when it first came out and have never [[unattended]] it. My Uncle Antoine is much, much [[fatter]] than the sum of it's parts. The movie, loosely, is about a pre-adolescent who is sent to live with a relative in a small town in Canada. There are adventures that seem more or less typical but underneath there is a current building. MUA has a leisurely pace but have patience, the reward is coming. I believe the film was sub-titled and as with all non-English speaking movies I've seen it is well worth avoiding any dubbed version. Inevitably dubbed movies reflect the attitudes of a new director and actors, with the additional necessity of lip-synching lines that don't quite fit. The English speaking Amarcord is a travesty, for example, while the sub-titled version sings. My Uncle Antoine is well [[pity]] the time to find and [[staring]] it in French.

Airplane apart, I don't think I've ever laughed at a film so much in all my life.  I love football like mad, but I tend to hate almost any song or film about football as they tend to be unrealistic. This wasn't.  I watched it once, it was over 2 years ago & it was [[perspicacious]]. Everyone I know loved it. I remember the gay physio, the sloping pitch at about a 45 degree angle and 'Shoes' (a player so named because he once turned up for training in a new pair of shoes). Brilliant, that's what goes on in park football.  A definite 10/10. If anyone from the TV industry is reading this, considering all the crap you repeat on English tele, please have the sense to show this again (and the Muppets while you're at it). Also does anyone know if this was shown on BBC or ITV. I think it was ITV, so it's worth asking them if they plan to show it again. They should do.
I can honestly tell you that this movie is the most [[silly]] movie ever!!! If you are in the mood for a comedy, I totally recommend this movie! So, here's the summary. There is this girl(Nikki) who is fourteen and a half and she goes on a vacation with her father(Andre) whom she hasn't seen for about two years. She expects the vacation to be totally boring, until she meets this boy(Ben), who is much older than she is. So, to try to impress him she says that she isn't on vacation with her father, but her lover. This is a hysterical movie from beginning to end, and I highly suggest it. So rent it and [[quit]]!!!

more trifle than [[others]] .
This is one of the few movies that was recommended to me as absolutely brilliant, that really is. If you give this [[travesty]] a low note than you really missed the point. You could describe Fosca as manipulative, but what if it is really serious, that she gets ill when the love she is sure of isn't answered. But what would you do when you are sure that the other one loves you, and is 'only' rejected by the fact that you are ugly. Wouldn't you fight for it. At least I think it is better to fight for it that die in bitterness. And it reminds me of the fact how I, as a man, react at first sight completely on the physical ugliness of Fosca and don't look further at the person she is or might be. This movie confronts me with very solemn questions about respect, trust, feeling manipulated and so on. How do I now if someone manipulates me or is just trying everything to make contact? What I think to be the most outstanding feature in this movie is that Ettore Scola made it absolutely believable that Giorgio falls in love with Fosca.

Hardware Wars is a [[travesty]], 12 minute short film parody of the original Star Wars movie which was released just a few months after Star Wars in 1977. This film uses household appliances as space ships and Star Wars look-a-like actors to send you rolling around on the floor in uncontrollable fits of laughter. This film has won many awards at film festivals and was the film which inspired Mel Brooks to write his Star Wars parody movie called "Spaceballs".  This is my favorite parody film and I recommend it to anyone who is familiar with Star Wars and has a good sense of humor.  
I went to Double Helix with two friends for his birthday, and had one of the best experiences I could think ofuck  Way better than I expected.  We started the night with appetizers and wine in the restaurant part of the bar.  Our waitress was extremely friendly, polite, and knew what to recommend based on our tastes.  She even recommended the wines for us perfectly.  As we sat there talking, one of my friends had a question.  He waved down someone he thought was working there, and we come to find out that the person we waved down was the GM of the store.  It was nice to see the GM working just as hard as his employees.  We ended up having a nice conversation about the types of cigars, and he [[again]] helped make recommendations on what we should get for cigars.  Overall, our experience at the store was [[striking]].  The employees were helpful, the GM was amazing, and the food and cigars were [[irreproachable]].

It's been a long time since such an [[rudimentary]], quite funny, black comedy has surfaced. If "Eating Raoul" is on your top 100 list, do yourself a favor and find "Undertaking Betty" immediately. The subject of death being funny has been attempted before (see Paul Bartel and Mary Woronov in "Mortuary Academy"). [[Except]] that movie has some brilliant moments of black comedy, "Undertaking Betty" is much more steady, with a better cast. [[Which]] could imagine that the [[promising]] business might be fertile ground for an original, uplifting, and heartfelt comedy? I was [[infuriated]] and you will be too. I [[excessively]] recommend seeing "Undertaking Betty" - MERK

[[originally]] and foremost I wish to aim a big & mean [[look]] towards the Troma DVD-distribution crew, who were [[always]] stupid enough to [[tell]] the identity of this movie's pivot killer on the [[edge]] of the cover! The synopsis just randomly [[comments]] who's the person responsible for the massacre on graduation [[point]], for Christ's sake! I don't care how [[brutal]] or how predictable an 80's slasher can be; just [[thinks]] who did it [[ruin]] the whole point! So, a word of advise in case you also purchase the Troma double-feature [[including]] "Graduation Day" and "Nymphoid Barbarian in Dinosaur [[world]]", do not   repeat DO NOT   turn the box around and read the back! [[sure]] the film is [[so]] a painful experience, but reading the back would really spoil [[everybody]].  Now, as for the actual the actual movie  Oh boy! Personally I'm a [[continuation]] of the cinematic 'work' of Herb Freed. Well actually, I don't really know whether I should admire him or pity him! All Herb's films are pretty [[good]] & amateurish, but at the same time you can tell his direction is spirited and full of good [[intention]]! [[in]] with "Haunts" and "Beyond Evil", he followed a contemporary popular genre trend and tried to cash in on the typical high-school slasher films. Just to offer a minimum of originality, all the victims in "Graduation Day" are promising athletes and members of the same track of coach George Michaels (awesome name! I guess Herb Freed is a fan of "Wham!"). During the opening credits, we witness how a young girl dramatically dies on the field, moments after winning a 30 seconds running race. The debate of whether or not her coach and fellow track team-members weren't pushing her physical limits too much is raised, but one particular individual goes one step further and begins to sadistically kill everyone he/she considers responsible for Laura's death. What a demented little movie! The script must be one of the most incoherent ones I ever beheld, with loads of red herrings and sub plots that go absolutely nowhere and death sequences that are almost too cheesy for words! There's a bloke impaled by a football attached to a javelin, others are decapitated with an absurdly big sword and the unluckiest bastard of them all even falls to his death on a disguised bed of spikes! Herb concentrates on the ingeniousness & the fast pacing of the killings so much that he totally forgets about the sub plots he introduced earlier in the film! For example, Laura's sister returns home from her military training and seemly starts an investigation regarding the circumstances of her death. Halfway through the movie, however, her character hardly appears in the movie anymore. Also, the girls' stepfather is referred to as a violent drunkard but this interesting given immediately gets ignored as well. Instead of carefully mounted suspense and misleading red herrings, we're served disco-dancing & roller-skating sequences and   of course   numerous images of unattractive 80's chicks stripping their tops off. Despite being really bad, "Graduation Day" could count on a respectable cast! Christopher George ("Grizzly", "City of the Living Dead") greatly stars as the demanding coach, Carmen Argenziano ("When a Stranger Calls", "The Accused") briefly appears as a police detective investigating the rising number of missing teenagers and Michael Pataki ("Dead & Buried", "Dracula's Dog") has a very amusing part as the school's stressed out principal. The teenage beauties on duty include Linnea Quigley and Vanna White. Heck, for some horror fans, the presence of these two ladies is enough reason already to count "Graduation Day" among the most quintessential slashers of the early 80's. It's a dumb film, but entertainment and chuckles are guaranteed!

Have I [[seeing]] a worse movie? No I can't [[affirming]] that I have. This was pathetic. If the director is still alive: 1. He shouldn't be. 2. He should be ashamed. 3. God, how I would like to take out my 2 completely wasted hours of time on his a$$.  To give you guys a few pointers of the "film":   1. (I'm a male) and I would rather give myself a papercut on the opening of my [[penile]] before viewing this again (seriously).  2. It does have a few known names in it (Casper Van Dien, [[Jaclyn]] Eleniak, Coolio). They don't [[aids]], and their careers in [[teatro]] after this "[[theatres]]" are officially over by the [[trajectories]].  3. The dialog is the [[finest]] I've ever [[hearing]]. "I want to ejaculate on your bozonkas."? What kind of [[cartoonist]] did they have on this film? Was he still using hooked-on-phonics and just got his letters mixed up to make these horrible sentences?, or was he trying to get the Director killed by the few people who saw this?   4. Watch this "film" backwards. Because I PROMISE you that you do not want to watch it forwards.  5. This "film" would make Helen Keller get up and walk out of the theater.  6. The set of the movie looks like an adult sized McDonald's playplace. I was just waiting for this so called "Dracula" to fall in the ball pit at some time in the movie.  7. Also, I like that in the year 3000 they still have headsets with wires that go to their mouth. No bluetooth, no wireless headsets, no chips placed in the brain, but they use headsets borrowed from a telemarketing agency that went out of business in 1983(Nice job Set director on this one. Real professional. I hope you're currently unemployed and reading this.)   8. I don't know who was in charge of special effects, but I could have done better in my backyard with my VHS camcorder that doesn't have a battery.  9. I was a devout Catholic before this "film". But since viewing it, I know there is not a God, because if there was, he wouldn't have let this film be produced. I am now an atheist.  10. I'll be honest I can't talk about the ending. Last time I tried to explain it I fell into a coma.  Folks however bored you get, however curious(or brave) you are, however many laughs you THINK you will get out of this movie, please DO NOT WATCH THIS. It has literally ruined my life. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!  Comment to the director: I hate you. You have ruined my life. After viewing this I feel empty inside. My wife and kids have left me and hate me because I couldn't speak or hardly move after seeing this. I lost my job, my dignity, and above all my pride. I will never forgive you in this life or the next(which is not looking good from my newfound beliefs) .

many people said this was a great movie with Hoffman delivering a great performance. i went from suspended disbelief, to fidgety boredom, to almost walking out. there is no there there.  Hoffman does go all out. he is committed to the performance. but sometimes him playing an affected man looks just like affected actor chewing on the scenery.  no characters in the movie other than capote are much more than placeholders - nell, jack, perry, shawn, the sheriff are all one-dimensional.  yes the film shows the manipulative, preening, [[deceitful]] sides of capote. it shows them so many times i started to wonder why -- do the filmmakers think we need to have everything spelled out? and again? and again? it refers often to capote's genius but does not show it. it shows him surrounded by fans and flatterers but never convinces us why.  but my goal is not to deconstruct the film. i am sure others will have other interpretations. for me, this was a two-hour movie that felt like five.

I just finished watching Dog Watch. I thought parts of the movie were hokey with more than a few implausibilities. The acting wasn't too bad and the plot wasn't bad. BUT, as the saying goes, the devil was in the details.  Some examples:  1) The bleed-through on Charlie Falon's (Sam Elliott) bandage was shown to be coming from the back of his hand while it was his knuckles that were bleeding.  2) Would a detective dispose of his murder victim from a very well-lighted area? This seemed very silly to me.  I am not unusually picky about a movie but, in my humble opinion, this one is definitely [[PAS]] recommended by me.
[[Drastic]] service. We went for a belated birthday and they treated us very nicely and with a lot of attention. This place is easy to find and pretty central. We got the 33oz bone in ribeye, mac and cheese, and also brussels sprouts. We ordered it medium rare and it came out pretty rare in general (which was fine with us). The ambiance is nice and since it's a large open kitchen with patio and bar space...you have a lot of options in terms of seating.

i have seen many Japanese horrorfilms and i have to say that some of them are really interesting but they are all [[splendidly]] much the same. this one is no exception. the ghost is a black haired girl, that scares it's victims by doing nothing else than walk and look dead.. the difference is just the motive for the haunting. the rest is the same as every time: black haired girl, strange things happening with some media (photos), creepy acting. while watching this flick i constantly found myself asking why i was wasting my time watching stuff that someone else has done so much better before. some scenes where quite nice though, i'll give it 3 out of 10

Unlike the many who have posted here, I'm not movie [[schooled]]. I [[tumble]] across this movie by accident (channel surfing), and couldn't surf away. This is a truly incredible movie, worthy of all the praise the [[critic]] and those on this site have heaped on it. The actors are terrific. Tatiana is beautiful and [[harmless]]. Her fiancé Boris is sweet and patriotic. You couldn't help but feel Boris' father's exasperation and sorrow as he upbraids his son for such [[bullshit]] as volunteering to serve in the great war.  Others have summarized the movie so well, so I'll just [[talking]] a couple of scenes that moved me the most. When Boris' brother reveals to his family that he has broken trust with his brother and "has to marry" Tatiana, Tatiana's twisted mouth shows her [[mutiny]] at this betrayal (even though her part in the unfaithfulness might have been through rape). You fear that the rest of the movie [[danger]] right this wrong by visiting just destruction on Tatiana and the brother, or [[lousiest]], show Tatiana destroyed by an [[unholy]] descent into cigarette smoking decadence. Since this isn't "French existential cinema", the latter doesn't happen. Thankfully!   Another scene that tears at your heart is when the unnamed "musician" soldier who was saved by Boris returns to tell Boris' father of the death of his son. He unwittingly breaks the news to Tatiana. I can't describe the sorrow of this scene... Still,Tatiana finds finds a straw to grab and hope that Boris will yet come home. The musician actually never saw Boris buried, after all.  I won't mention more scenes, but do want to observe that the touches of Soviet political correctness didn't detract at all from the film. Boris' brother is revealed as the piano playing anti-soviet slacker that someone who steals his brother's wife-to-be would have to be. No doubt he gets at least a "tenner" at the conclusion of the film! The ending, when Tatiana finally learns for certain that Boris is dead, still manages to end with cheerfully and full of hope for the future. You don't even want to imagine the tears and catharsis that must have swept through the theater when survivors of that war, with their own losses in mind, first saw this movie.  Incredible. Go see it.

Ridiculously [[astonishing]] show!!!!  Hubby and I were completely astonished!   Sat in the "premium seats (the middle between splash zone and VIP)" section A, H 15&16.  [[Deemed]] the VIP section but after seeing the seats, don't think they're really worth it...they seat further back but the seats are rather lush.  Guess it really boils down to whether or not you really want the champagne!  Saw some people in the splash zone move up to the 'premium seats' shortly after the first gig - I'd pay the extra $30 to not sit in the splash zone...but if you can choose seats in the 2nd row up I [[supposing]] its good savings? I prefer Orchestra like seats so H did us just fine.  Don't look up any videos on this!  It's best to go in with no [[vistas]]...get ready to be blown away!! :)
AVANTI APARTMENTS authorizes tow truck companies to tow their own resident's cars in the middle of the night. I had a problem getting my car registered. The city put a hold on my license plate for old parking tickets I was in the middle of disputing. After I got an orange ticket put on my car threatening to tow it I contacted the Avanti office. The guy I [[avowed]] to, who identified himself as the assistant manager, said [[uh]] my car would be towed because those were the the rules in the lease I entered into. I [[endeavors]] to explain to him my situation and that I was trying to take care of it, and that if my car was towed I would lose my job and then couldn't pay them rent. He [[bypassed]] me and repeated rules are rules and yes my car would probably be towed in ONE DAY. The whole time he was talking to me like a child who [[despised]] him and not like a tenant who pays his salary. They're hundreds of apartments to choose from in Las Vegas.

This movie is not about the soda nor is it quite the French Connection.  The Seven Ups are a group of elite policemen that use tactics not in accordance with protocol of the NYPD. [[chase]] heads the group with his posse or regular looking joes. They are running surveillance on a local [[la]] nostra cartel and [[something]] go awry when a cop's wire is found out.  Meanwhile, Richard Lynch, the most evil looking man in film (Invasion:America, [[st]] Nikita) and his partner end up killing the cop by accident and escape from Scheider in the [[least]] chase scene I've seen, Bullitt and French Connection are not as good as they one up the West Side to the George Washington and onto the Palisades Parkway in New Jersey.   [[some]] stunt drivers are terrific and Lynch makes it away free though he looks scared [[somehow]] from the dangerous trip. Roy Scheider is nearly killed when his car slams into the abutted rear of Mack truck ripping the roof of his vehicle off.

I saw this film when it first came out and have [[barely]] [[remembered]] it. My Uncle Antoine is much, much [[more]] than the sum of it's parts. The movie, loosely, is about a pre-adolescent who is sent to live with a relative in a small town in Canada. There are adventures that seem more or less typical but underneath there is a current building. MUA has a leisurely pace but have patience, the reward is coming. I believe the film was sub-titled and as with all non-English speaking movies I've seen it is well worth avoiding any dubbed version. Inevitably dubbed movies reflect the attitudes of a new director and actors, with the additional necessity of lip-synching lines that don't quite fit. The English speaking Amarcord is a travesty, for example, while the sub-titled version sings. My Uncle Antoine is well [[outside]] the time to find and watch it in French.

This place definitely has an awesome ambiance...very trendy chic. In respect to the food, there was definitely something left to be desired there. I love how a place claims to be tapas...but it is just smaller portions of a regular dish. That is not tapas! True tapas is small portions yes but incredibly [[delicious]] and delectable...something that packs a punch! The food here was okay...we tried the risotto, fish, pasta, and the cheese platter (pretty [[bad]]), just to mention a few. For me personally, not [[for]] the price. I have had [[longer]] and cheaper tapas in NYC.
Love the location especially when the ice skating rink is up and running. Sitting on the patio is pretty chill watching all the people happily skating around. Every time I have come for happy hour drinks with or without snacks, there is some kind of [[harass]] ordering-- can't find wine, or glasses or how to ring it up on cash register, but I keep coming back because it is  a relaxing place to hang out without a ton of creeps--- it is what is is and for the most part it is just fine.
The year 2004 was the year of the biopic with no less than four pictures tackling real events, real people, with varying degrees of [[dodgy]] praise. Of the four pictures to make it to the race to the Oscars in early 2005 (KINSEY, THE AVIATOR, HOTEL RWANDA, and, RAY), RAY became the big winner of the night as the acting award went to Jamie Foxx for his portrayal of R & B genius Ray Charles.  And it was well-deserved despite that Leonardo diCaprio came close and Liam Neeson wasn't even nominated. What made Foxx the winner was that the other two were playing relatively obscure eccentrics, Ray Charles was still making music right up until his death in 2004 and by then there wasn't a soul who didn't know at least one song that Charles' had penned. It did help that Jamie Foxx rose well above the movie -- itself as a whole somewhat weak and often looking like it wouldn't be out of place as a TV biopic -- and his portrayal is detailed as it's ferocious. He has the delicate assignment which is to embody a person down to nuances, and once the crisis of Ray's addiction to heroin hits a head, Foxx pulls out all the stops and it isn't hard to imagine the real Ray actually going through such a painful ordeal.  The low point of the film is how it spends a little too much time in detailing Ray's relationship with women. Like THE AVIATOR, Taylor Hackford wishes to establish that Ray had this turbulent life, a product of his own demons and his entry into success at a time when being black and successful brought a huge amount of baggage. Of the women, the only one to succeed bringing real life is Sharen Warren as Ray's mother. Hers is a difficult role since she is alone on screen with the child actor playing young Ray but her facial and body language is gut-wrenching, especially at the moment she must relinquish her maternity to have Ray find his way around the house. Such intensity of emotion, to stand there and watch your blind son crawl across a room and having to force him to have this rude awakening into independence. A beautiful performance, and one which should have been acknowledged.  A fantastic counterpoint to RAY is the featured music. Anyone who knows R & B will enjoy the early recordings of Ray's radio hits as much as his later ones which would bring him to the forefront of popular music, and Jamie Foxx virtually steals the show as he performs the songs as Ray. That alone will live on even when the movie in itself is little more than a stiff biopic. I would have, though, loved it if they would have used his last Adult Contemporary hit from 1993, "Sing my Song for You" in the closing credits. After all, it is Ray Charles, a performer who had a fierce dedication to his art.

Nice movie. At the begining, i thought it's a medieve detective kind hi-fi movie, but the ending [[disastrously]] surprised me. I guess, the whole movie covers too many subjects, each of them can be the main subject,e.g. avenge, friendship, and dream. But it mixed all of them without focusing on any of them. I think, it'd be a great movie if it's built around the ending from the very begining.

This was the best film I [[enjoyed]] in the [[enjoyment]] 2000. The Cohen [[hermano]] [[recieve]] never [[vacations]] me down before, and they [[categorically]] didn't this [[dated]] either.  It's one of those [[casual]] [[filming]] these days - it's [[psychotropic]], [[canny]] and [[severely]] entertaining. I left the cinema with a warmth in my heart. Of course, there's [[consignment]] of Cohen [[dope]] in there - [[abnormal]] [[roles]] and [[grained]] gadgets, well-developed [[graphs]] and [[fairy]] camerawork. But no Cohen film is resembling any other [[Hirsch]] [[cinematographer]], if you [[euphemism]] the [[global]] quality of them, of course.  The big surprise for me was that Clooney is so good. [[Yet]] the [[factual]] master performance in this movie comes from Tim Blake-Nelson. But the rest of the cast is superb too.  A [[visuals]] that is lightweight comedy with a musical touch that evolve it's story round rednecks and old time country music - dripping with wit and intelligence. Thats a very unlikely combination. But it's exactly what this picture is.

Having reviewed 3 of the 4 Perry and Croft sitcoms, I thought I would get them all done now. Dads Army, is my all time favourite sitcom, It ain't half hot Mum is also a classic as is You Rang M'Lord. I don't regard Hi De Hi as a classic, but it is still [[humorous]].  It's about a holiday camp, similar to Butlins, but instead of red coats, it's yellow coats. It is ran by Jeffery Fairbrother, a well meaning man, but has the personality of a sock. The staff include fun entertainment manager Ted, his sidekick Spike (he ended up being thrown in the swimming pool nearly every episode), yellow coat Gladys, careless maid Peggy who longed to be a yellow coat and the Punch and Judy man Mr Partridge who hates kids. Situations occurred mostly round the swimming pool, where someone would be thrown in every episode (with there clothes on of course).  Not a [[usual]], but still funny. Jeffery Fairbrother [[exit]] half way through, so this, a bit like Only Fools and Horses, outstayed its welcome. Jimmy Perry was actually a red coat at Butlins.  Best Episode: Peggy's Big Chance, series 2, episode 2.

Hardware Wars is a [[laughable]], 12 minute short film parody of the original Star Wars movie which was released just a few months after Star Wars in 1977. This film uses household appliances as space ships and Star Wars look-a-like actors to send you rolling around on the floor in uncontrollable fits of laughter. This film has won many awards at film festivals and was the film which inspired Mel Brooks to write his Star Wars parody movie called "Spaceballs".  This is my favorite parody film and I recommend it to anyone who is familiar with Star Wars and has a good sense of humor.

I really like Terrace, and I like that they are locally owned and operated. While I cut my teeth at the Piedmont Row location, I found this Ballantyne restaurant to be fulfilling as well.  The space was once something else...and I ate there once. It wasn't very memorable. So I was super excited to see that Terrace was moving in.   Having been for dinner (3 stars), I direct my attention to their extensive breakfast and brunch offerings ([[one]] [[star]]). I have had several menu items here, but the [[basics]] are:  * Oatmeal (so, so [[fine]]) * Omelette with tomato, spinach and mozz (if they feel like letting me have mozz that day, since it's not on the omelette menu) * RED VELVET WAFFLE (not for the faint of heart. quite sweet.) * Blueberry pancakes   I appreciate that they're trying to do the dinner thing, but it's just not happening. I'd recommend going for breakfast/lunch (they serve breakfast [[another]] [[times]] until 2:30).   I'm getting hungry... Who wants to meet me for lunch?
We had pretty disappointing service here and the [[restaurants]] was not worth the [[royalty]] we paid.  The hostesses were not [[immensely]] accommodating when we [[reacts]] that no, we [[gotten]] not have a reservation.  We noticed there were plenty of open tables in the [[meals]] ... [[ultimately]] those were in fact for [[man]] who had [[reserve]].  They told us we could sit in the [[barre]] or their next [[accessible]] [[inaugurated]] was at 9:30 [[phosphorus]].m. (no thanks), so we sat in the bar.  The [[vinaigrette]] I [[instructing]] was only lettuce with dressing and a [[primal]] of [[torched]] with sardines on it.  [[Consequently]] that constitutes a salad worth paying more than a couple of bucks for I don't know.  Our friend's pasta came out with a hair in it so she sent it back.  We waited a while to get a fresh plate out.  In the meantime, we asked several times for new silverware and no one could seem to be bothered to bring us new silverware so we got up and got it ourselves from their cabinet.  The other plates we ordered were mediocre at [[preferably]] - nothing to [[typist]] [[fireplaces]] about.  [[Complements]] this was very [[dreary]].  [[Our]] often stay at the Palazzo and it is [[fantastic]] to have a convenient restaurant in the hotel, but we will not be eating here again.  Would recommend spending this kind of money somewhere else!
This is a fun family restaurant I will say the inside is quite old I was disappointed with the grease that was used for the to deep fry oil needed to be changed the coleslaw was not that great but everything else was very [[bad]] the staff is young but friendly and we went on a Friday evening and it was not that busy overall this is a fun Country Western restaurant.

Airplane apart, I don't think I've ever [[funny]] at a film so much in all my life.  I love football like mad, but I tend to hate almost any song or film about football as they tend to be unrealistic. This wasn't.  I watched it once, it was over 2 years ago & it was brilliant. Everyone I know loved it. I remember the gay physio, the sloping pitch at about a 45 degree angle and 'Shoes' (a player so named because he once turned up for training in a new pair of shoes). [[Ravishing]], that's what goes on in park football.  A definite 10/10. If anyone from the TV industry is reading this, considering all the crap you repeat on English tele, please have the sense to show this again (and the Muppets while you're at it). Also does anyone know if this was shown on BBC or ITV. I think it was ITV, so it's worth asking them if they plan to show it again. They should do.
Centres on Czech WW2 pilots   the older Frantisek, the boyish impulsive Karel and in the background the quiet piano-playing Honza. As the [[travesty]] opens, it is 1950, the war is over and Frantisek and Honza are imprisoned in a former monastery. In their now Soviet-controlled native country they are 'enemy of the people'. Honza is severely maltreated by his Communist countrymen and dies.  In 1939 many pilots manage to escape German-occupied Europe and make their way to England where they join the RAF. Notwithstanding their high motivation and experience they face RAF reluctance and British stiff upper lip. Finally they fight gallantly in the Battle of Britain. However, Frantisek and Karel find their friendship severely tested when they both fall for the same woman.  In terms of romantic sub-plot, this is very similar to the Hollywood production Pearl Harbour. However, given the context of the film and Frantisek's eventual fate, it is also possible to read the English woman's treatment of the two men as symbolic of British treatment of the Czech and Polish RAF pilots: conveniently forgetting them once the war is over.  In addition, the film is a lot less cliché than Pearl Harbour and the characters are more fully realised. Dark Blue World also scores in terms of its stunning aerial dogfights, which were seamlessly created using a mixture of models, actual live-action aerial filming and out-takes from the 1969 epic The Battle of Britain.  In short, Dark Blue World is a well-made, moving, thought-provoking and exciting drama that puts the likes of Pearl Harbour to shame. Highly recommended.

Victor Sjöström was quite the master in this film, having starred in it, directed it and even wrote the screenplay! That's pretty amazing. While today few have any idea who Sjöström was, he might be familiar to Ingmar Bergman fans as the star one of Bergman's most acclaimed films, WILD STRAWBERRIES.  As far as this film goes, it's a very mixed bag. On one hand, you have to respect it because for 1921, it's a very [[interesting]] film. The idea of the Grim Reaper sitting down with a dead man to discuss his wasted life is pretty imaginative. Plus, the special effect of the Phantom Carriage is pretty convincing and technically speaking this is a well-crafted film. On the other hand, it's an amazingly dated and preachy film--more like something you'd expect to be shown in Sunday School instead of in an honest to goodness theater. Plus, some of the story elements just don't make sense. Instead of coming off as dedicated or good, the dying Salvation Army worker seems like a sap--a very sad and confusing sap. Why is she "in love" with this man? Am I missing something?  So, my recommendation is that if you are insanely in love with silents (like me), then by all means watch it. But, if you aren't a silent fan, this film might do nothing to convince you that this style film is brilliant because the story is so overly melodramatic and dated.

It just so happens that IVAN THE TERRIBLE, PARTS I and II both had entries in the 50 Worst Movies book by Harry Medved. Now, I do think that declaring they are among the worst movies ever is an overstatement, though they are still both [[splendidly]] poor films--particularly the first one, as it featured more eye rolling and "googly eyed looks" than I have ever seen before!! Director Eisenstein and an awful lot of other people out there thought this made the film "artsy and profound"--and since I am legally sane, I must say that I hated this first film!! The second, while still very incomplete-looking, is a vast improvement, as eye rolling is minimal, though overacting and long boring scenes are present in this film just like in part 1! While part 2 looks pretty incomplete and needed at least another hour (especially since it never gets to Ivan's insane behavior later in life--like killing his son and heir while in a fit of anger). Since both parts 1 and 2 were commissioned by Stalin to both excuse his own murderous reign and glorify him, it's no surprise that Ivan's life story is left very incomplete. Even without all the truly awful behaviors of Ivan, apparently the supremely evil Stalin STILL didn't like the film and wouldn't allow its release during his lifetime. Maybe he didn't allow this because he was more worried people would see what a HUGE waste of money and resources the film was instead of seeing Stalin as a crazy guy just like Ivan!   By the way, there was one segment of this tedious film that was just so cool that the film merits a 4 (without it, a 2)--and that's the scene with Prince Vladimir at the banquet! It is well-done and pretty funny in a dark way. And, the scene was done in a Russian version of 2-color Technicolor. This is VERY odd, by the way, because by the mid-1930s, a vastly improved true color process was developed by Technicolor that no longer made everything look all orangy-red and greenish-blue. So, this film during the color sequences looks a lot like a silent or early sound color film. Very odd indeed for the 1940s.

This usually all sounds a lot better in my head (so forgive me for rambling) I'm hardly Tarantino's biggest [[blowers]] (and will *try* not to stoop to calling him a 'hack'....which is quite hard) I don't like to mock or critique a movie before seeing it. So with cautious hesitation, i walked to the cinema today to watch 'Inglorious Basterds'  Now, to call it a 'rip-off of a rip-off' would be unfair here. Tarantino is happy enough to take the title from Enzo Castellari's (less than spectacular) Dirty Dozen clone, but not it's plot points (that, he takes from all other genre of movies) 'Inglorious' opens with a Nazi officer and his lengthy interrogation against a farmer who is hiding Jews in his basement. This is such an anti-climax, in that, it's [[dialog]] is [[ancient]], and outcome signposted a mile off. Of course, one of the hidden Jews makes her escape (but more of her later) We (the obviously, easily pleased) audience are treated to the introduction of Lt. Aldo Raine (ha-ha, that name almost sounds like B-movie king ALDO RAY....ha-ha Quentin...keep those 'tributes' coming) and this character is played by none other than Brad (DALLAS) Pitt (sorry, DALLAS was about the only good thing he's ever starred in) and with jaw-jutting, Mr Jolie treats us to a hound-dogged, southern drawled, smirking Nazi-killer. Meanwhile Mr Tarantino forgets that actual grown-ups may be in attendance, so assumes that the teenyboppers won't have heard of the 'Dirty Dozen'?  Raines 'platoon' consists of (John Cassavettes looking) blood-thirsty Jewish soldiers, all looking to get the big payback on Adolf Hitler. Tarantino in all his superior knowledge, pays special attention to two of these men, by casting his long time best buddy (and fellow homage-sycophant) Eli Roth (as the baseball bat wielding 'Bear Jew') The other man is called Hugo Stiglitz (and i'll wager more than half the QT fan-boys had never heard this name before this movie) Keep up the good work Tarantino, you've managed about 6 or 7 'hommages' so far (in the first 15 minutes) keep adding them, and it may detract from the plot (or lack of?)  Anyhow, cutting a long (and extremely boring and protracted) story short, both Raine and his men (the 'Inglorious Basterds') and the sole survivor from chapter one, both have separate plots to kill Hitler at the showing of a Nazi-propaganda movie, in a french cinema (owned by the fore-mentioned survivor, now grown up)  More boring (and pointless) conversations follow two and fro, as Pitt mugs away at an audience past caring. And any genuine suspense, leading to the assassination of the most deadly tyrant of all time, is thrown-away by the directors insistence of placing a 1980's David Bowie song in a WWII movie.  My problems (and there are many) with this movie, is the re-occurring problem i have with most Tarantino product.....he rarely knows when to either start or stop. I don't need 'homage' after 'homage' to get the *joke* (whatever it may be) I knew of Inglorious Bastards, Enzo Castellari, Aldo Ray, Hugo Stiglitz (and the ultimate crime of the entire movie) Ennio Morricone's haunting score from REVOLVER. I go to the cinema to see the stars.....if the best you can do is the dire Barad Pitt, i'll assume You (Mr Tarantino) are the main draw here? I don't want the audience directing the movie. I pay to see YOUR vision, your ideas, your creativity....NOT how you can patchwork (time and time again) endless scenes from endless movies. It's high time the fan-boys (on IMDb) employed some 'tough love' on your 'idol' (god knows, if you don't....the studios should?)  The tired old argument with Tarantino worshippers is "well, if you can do better...do so" Let me tell you, if i was a 46 year old director, with the (unfortunate) pull QT has.....i'd want to offer YOU a lot more than a warmed up muddled re-hash of better WWII movies than this tripe. The directors he attempts to emulate, made movies so bad by accident, or due to budgetary constraints. It's a cop out, time and time again, to hear his fans campaign his lack of imagination as 'art'. I'm sure he's capable of better (but after giving him the benefit of the doubt, once more....and not to mention 2 and a half hours of my life.....) maybe he isn't?

After a long hard night being partied away at the Walkabout in Islington, I needed a pick-me-up. My throat hurt, my wallet was empty and I ended up chatting to a drug addict at a bus-stop trying to sell me some petrol. Today, I watched "Red Sonja" and I can honestly say that I felt much better last night than I do right now. Brigitte Nielsen leads a bunch of ass-kicking warriors in various shapes and sizes to recover a green rock from some evil queen whose motives are never fully explained. Yep, it's that good.  "Red Sonja" isn't in a genre known for great films until Peter Jackson came along with a certain Oscar-winning trilogy. In fact, the best swords-and-sorcery film I could think of before "Lord Of The Rings" was George Lucas's kiddie-friendly "Willow". Perhaps, in view of this, one should go a little easy on this film. But I can't - it's poorly written, badly acted (with the exception of Paul Smith, who's just average) and [[too]] put together. The film is as convincing as an episode of the Flintstones, with costumes and scenery seemingly lifted straight outta Bedrock. Considering the comic-book source material, it is easy to forgive the various plot inconsistencies. Why Sonja insists on saving the most annoying kid, in this world or that one, is bewildering. His personality seems to flick from spoilt brat to polite gentleman at the flick of a switch. Schwarzenegger displays less charisma than a field full of cows and just goes through the motions, a perfect actor for his breakthrough role in "The Terminator".  It's simple to kick a film when you're down but the fact remains that this is not a good film, by any stretch of the imagination. When Nielsen mourns the death of her sister and Schwarzenegger tenderly places his hand on her shoulder to comfort her and then blurts out, in that distinctive Germanic accent, "she's dead" then you know you're in for a rough ride. A few smiles were raised at inappropriate points, such as the priestesses of a temple who, when sent plunging to their deaths in a hole in the ground, seemed to enjoy the experience - at least, judging from the orgasmic moans that seemed to echo around the place. If you have to watch an Eighties fantasy film that wasn't porn, watch "Willow" (but never take that as a ringing endorsement). For the real thing, take yourself to your local multiplex and show Peter Jackson what a great job he did with "Lord Of The Rings". Trust me, 11 Oscars really does mean it's a great film - unlike bloody "Titanic".

Lots of fast talking, everybody [[shouts]] at everybody, and the two page boys call the police detective "Marty" (played by Ralph Sanford). It's a real "shortie" at 59 minutes, and it has the feel of being adapted from a play, since it mostly takes place in a radio station soundstage.

This is a luminously photographed and [[unnaturally]] well-written [[northwestern]] by veteran creator of "Rawhide" Charles Marquis Warren. Direcxtor Gordon Douglas is its chief help in this [[sensation]]. Its strong plot line can be told in a few sentences. A hard-nosed by-the- book, Cavalry officer, Captain Richard Lance, captures a leader of the Indian enemy after a massacre at a fort. He insists on bringing the man back for trial, to be sent toTucson; his commander sends another man to try to take the prisoner for trial and the patrol is wiped out. This means the leader has escaped, and Lance must now lead a second patrol--and he picks the men the fort can most spare, a company of problems-- to defend the advance fort that had been wiped out and save the command from another attack by stopping up the bottleneck pass in that sector. As Lance, young Gregory Peck is quite strong. Other in the large cast of this film which really shows [[iife]] at a cavalry outpost looking like an army establishment of heterogeneous and quarreling types [[composed]] War Bond powerful as a hard-drinking sergeant, Neville Brand and Steve Brodie as troublemakers, Warner Anderson and Lon Chaney Jr. as psychological troublemakers and Gig Young, Art Baker, Herbert Heyes as fellow officers with Nana Bryant as the Colonel's wife. Even Barbara Payton as the love interest gets by in a difficult role; Michael Ansara is the captured war chief, and Jeff Corey plays the Fort's scout. There are really two great scenes in this very-well-made western--the long section at the fort before the last patrol is sent out, and that long patrol to the doomed Ft. Defiant itself. Once at that fort, Peck gets to deliver a grand speech in which at the demand of the men he has lined up for orders, he tells them each why he took them along. reading them their shortcomings one by one; they then tell them why they think he sent his best friend to die in his place take the Indian in instead of going himself-- and he proves them wrong for the remainder of the film by winning his lonely battle through intelligence and courage. The music by Franz Waxman is good, the production qualities admirable; the argument about what would happen if Lance takes the war chief in happens to be true; other than this unsolvable mistake by the central character, this is is great western. it has been a favorite of mine for fifty years.

This movie was terrible. It was so very [[terrific]].  Most annoying was the way the trial was conducted. The defense attorney is allowed to ramble on and on when questioning a witness without the prosecution making any objections. He attacks the children brought to give testimony with cruel ferociousness and repeatedly yells at them that they're lying. These just aren't things that they subject children who have been sexually abused to. The trial is silly and it ruins the whole movie...(Law & Order has spoiled me for courtroom accuracy-ness).

It just so happens that IVAN THE TERRIBLE, PARTS I and II both had entries in the 50 Worst Movies book by Harry Medved. Now, I do think that declaring they are among the worst movies ever is an overstatement, though they are still both pretty [[mala]] films--particularly the first one, as it featured more eye rolling and "googly eyed looks" than I have ever seen before!! Director Eisenstein and an awful lot of other people out there thought this made the film "artsy and profound"--and since I am legally sane, I must say that I [[antipathy]] this first film!! The second, while still very incomplete-looking, is a vast improvement, as eye rolling is minimal, though overacting and long boring scenes are present in this film just like in part 1! While part 2 looks pretty incomplete and needed at least another hour (especially since it never gets to Ivan's insane behavior later in life--like killing his son and heir while in a fit of anger). Since both parts 1 and 2 were commissioned by Stalin to both excuse his own murderous reign and glorify him, it's no surprise that Ivan's life story is left very incomplete. Even without all the truly awful behaviors of Ivan, apparently the supremely evil Stalin STILL didn't like the film and wouldn't allow its release during his lifetime. Maybe he didn't allow this because he was more worried people would see what a HUGE waste of money and resources the film was instead of seeing Stalin as a crazy guy just like Ivan!   By the way, there was one segment of this tedious film that was just so cool that the film merits a 4 (without it, a 2)--and that's the scene with Prince Vladimir at the banquet! It is well-done and pretty funny in a dark way. And, the scene was done in a Russian version of 2-color Technicolor. This is VERY odd, by the way, because by the mid-1930s, a vastly improved true color process was developed by Technicolor that no longer made everything look all orangy-red and greenish-blue. So, this film during the color sequences looks a lot like a silent or early sound color film. Very odd indeed for the 1940s.

If you find the first 30 [[minute]] of this film to be so slow that you wonder why you're watching it, don't give up. Also, hearing the Danish language is a bit new to most North Americans, who don't see and hear a lot of Danish films. Anyway, as the film progressed it got better and [[preferably]] and the viewer is [[compensating]] for his/her patience.  Being a fan of the movie, "Out Of Africa," this [[imaging]] piqued my interest because it's based on a short novel by Isak Dinesen (Karen Blixen), the major character in that film.  The meal - Babette's feast - was amazing. I'm no chef, but [[me]] was [[awesome]]! How one interprets the story, too, [[fluctuates]], I suppose depending on how much you read into this, and where you stand religion-wise. If the latter, how you look at the definition of "legalism" can affect how you interpret this story.  In any case, it's a fine film, but don't [[sighting]] this if you're dieting.

I know it's rather unfair to comment on a movie without [[reading]] the complete piece - but I am going to anyway! [[who]] waited for a laugh, I tried to [[tell]] it time. I think 20 minutes is [[usually]] [[long]] to wait in a comedy for a laugh. My laugh [[immediately]] came, so I [[finished]] up.  It's stupid humour, not so stupid that you have to laugh, though. It isn't anywhere near that [[upper]] grade. [[let]] me [[put]] that, it's just *stupid* - not stupid humour. [[you]] [[d]] have intended for certain scenes to be funny, but they weren't. [[it]] suppose, if you were really bored you [[does]] somehow blend the movie with a hallucination and [[light]] up with a mildly entertaining experience.  A very [[decent]] effort.
So, we are waiting for a flight at 8AM and having a breakfast burrito at Blue Burrito (connected to Taberna del Tequila at Sky Harbor Airport) and I was complaining to my boyfriend that they don't give out their really good hot sauce anymore - instead they give Tapatio (sucks).

Classe Tous Risques (The Big Risk) is a [[Parisian]] gangster [[cinematographers]] that doesn't try for [[fashion]]. That's why it has style. Because the movie is so underplayed and so matter-of-fact, it becomes more and more [[implicates]]. And [[for]] Abel Davos is played by [[Flax]] Ventura, we wind up [[creatively]] invested in this [[blasé]], tough killer who loves his wife and kids, has an encounter with customs agents on the shore near Nice at night that neither he nor we expect, and who [[displayed]] just as willing to shoot a cop or a betrayer with as little emotion as flicking off a bit of lint. We first meet Davos in Italy with his wife and their two small boys, one about 9 and one 4.   "This man was Abel Davos, sentenced to death in absentia," we're told. "On the run for years, he had watched his resources dwindle, even as his anxiety kept him on the move. With the Italian police closing in each day, France was again his best bet. Maybe he'd been forgotten."   Davos was a top gangster in Paris who took care of his friends. That was several years ago. A heist to give him money to return to France goes very wrong. Now he's hiding out with his two kids. He calls his friends in Paris to help him out. He and his kids need to get from Nice to Paris but the police are hunting him and they've set up roadblocks. For Davos' two best friends, time has passed and they've moved on. They don't want to put themselves at risk, and for what? Obligation gives may to caution. So they hire a young thief, Eric Stark (Jean- Paul Belmondo), to pick up Davos and the children in an ambulance, then to drive to Paris with Davos heavily bandaged and the children hidden. We're on a journey where Davos' options are increasingly limited, where he must find ways to have his children cared for, where he realizes there are no more ties of friendship, where betrayal seems likely, and where quite possibly his only friend left is Eric Stark.   This somewhat cynical movie works so well because it does its job without fussing about. There are no trench coats with pulled-up collars, no toying with the melodrama of the gangster code so many French directors have loved. Classe tous Risques gives us Abel Davos, a man who once was somebody, who now is sliding down to be nobody, and who reacts with violence and resignation.   Lino Ventura dominates the movie, yet when he is paired with Jean-Paul Belmondo a curious chemistry happens. Ventura as Davos is grim and worried about caring for his sons. He is humiliated by his situation. He is a tough man who sees killing someone, if needed, as just part of the business he's in. Belmondo as the young thief who initially is sent to be an expendable driver and winds up being a friend to count on, provides the brightness that keeps the movie from being just one more ride down the elevator. Belmondo was 27 and looks younger. His unlikely star power as a lead actor -- broken nose, under-slung jaw -- shines right off the screen. He makes Erik a match for Ventura when they share a scene. And Belmondo's scenes with Liliane (Sandra Milo), the young woman who becomes his girl friend, radiate charm and good-natured sex appeal. The ending is bittersweet fate, and without a stylistic posture in sight. We hear Davos say, "Abel's gone. There's nothing left." It would be well worth watching Classe tous Risques to learn what he means.   There are many fine French gangster films. I'd place this one right there with Touchez Pas au Grisbi and Bob le Flambeur. To see one of Lino Ventura's finest performances, watch Army of Shadows.

Best Cinematography I have ever seen Considering the [[anno]] the movie was made I was absolutely amazed and thoroughly impressed with the [[money]] of [[caring]] dedicated to the [[photographed]] and with what appears to [[got]] authenticity. [[Unless]] I am not [[extremely]] a western [[theatre]] buff .[[any]] single scene is [[lodged]] the [[dire]] detail, and it is haunting. There is a [[avid]] connection with nature. At times I am [[topped]] with the amount of action passing through the scenes, but I am never bored. I feel as though I am truly peering into a time machine and looking back into the old west. I [[applauds]] this movie to anyone who is studying set design, location planning, and for that [[affair]] [[photo]] in [[overall]]. It can be a humbling [[cinemas]] to experience with [[connection]] to the visuals [[contemplating]] this [[duration]] of digital touch-up that we now experience.
The undoubted highlight of this movie is Peter O'Toole's performance. In turn wildly comical and terribly terribly tragic. Does anybody do it better than O'Toole? I don't think so. What a [[gargantuan]] face that man has!  The story is an odd one and quite disturbing and emotionally intense in parts (especially toward the end) but it is also oddly touching and does succeed on many levels. However, I felt the film basically revolved around Peter O'Toole's luminous performance and I'm sure I wouldn't have enjoyed it even half as much if he hadn't been in it.

This place is absolutely amazing. I was at an art show across the street, starving, late on a Saturday night and I knew I didn't want to deal with the hustle and bustle of old town eateries, I was so glad to stumble upon this amazing hidden jewel.  My boyfriend and I happen to be the only two in the place so our service was of [[routes]] outstanding. The food was great, we split the crab puffs, which were nothing special but still [[ok]]. I had the beef fried rice, just the presentation was impressive in itself the so to no surprise the taste was equally [[so]] over par. My boyfriend had a chicken curry dish he still raved about days later.  The only thing that might have made our experience less than [[parfait]] is that I ordered a pear saketini and the glass came only half full, strange, and the [[melodies]] was less then appealing, if I heard another instrumental version of the song from Titanic one more time during or meal I was going to scream, literally it played four times while we we there, which was only about an hour and a half.

I [[awfully]] [[experienced]] this Thai place and [[alacrity]] [[come]] coming back when I'm in town.  The bartender Mercy and one of her assistants, Andrew, were so very friendly.  They made me feel very welcome.  When they asked how I was liking my food, you could tell that they really had an interest in me being pleased.  I like that kind of invested interest.  I shared my meal with some friends so I had three entree's.   - The Pad Thai was a nice rice dish with a complex dash of sweet and sour.  I ordered it about a 3 star.  I could [[haya]] gone to a 5, I'm sure.  I was a newbie.  If you like hot, start with a 4 and go from there. - The short rib stir fried rice was good, but I wouldn't go there for that.  It was my least favorite of the three meals, though, I enjoyed it. - My favorite was the Three Color Curry.  That was wicked good.  It was a very flavorful soupy curry dish that you will need to mix your rice with (stir fried or white).  The unsung part of the meal was the pickled jalapeno's.  Apparently the pickling process makes the peppers sweet and the juice just blended well with all three of the meals that I added it to.  I'm a fan... I'll go back.

You know, this is one of those "Emperor's New Clothes" films. It's like, so off the wall and strange that you're SUPPOSED to like it if you're really into film. Well, I think that's a bunch of bologna. Films like this which hide under the cloak of Dada or surrealism make me nuts. Some [[people]] has this bad dream, perhaps brought on by eating the aforementioned bologna right before going to bed, remembers most of it (unfortunately) and then puts it on film and we're all supposed to marvel at their creative genius. I have bizarre dreams too, sometimes, that make absolutely no sense but I don't feel the need to put them on film, expose everybody else to them and call it art. Weirdness does not, in of itself, mean something is interesting. True Dada or surrealistic expression has SOME intent and intellectual thought behind it. If other people don't get it, that doesn't make it profound, it just makes it [[untold]]. Bizarreness for bizarreness sake, for me, is not [[exemplary]], let alone great, art. And comparing "Tuvalu" to "Delicatesen" is like comparing "The Godfather I & II" to "The Godfather III"---same genre, NOT in the same league.

I watched Gomeda on movie theater at my city. My [[friends]] took away me and I was really curious what would be it looked like. Well, I must say This movie was not a horror,may be we can say that is 'Fantsastic experimentation'...OK here I go anyway... But there was a lot of shooting,acting,dramatic,theatrical and storytelling [[techniques]].I can understand because of director is very [[great]] and Gomeda is his first feature film.OK Directing of this film was not pretty bad,I see.Unfortunately, due to the restraints placed on the film by its extremely low budget, the visuals are often as murky as the storyline.And there is no [[actual]] Gothic scenes.As a horror movie it really [[succeeds]], no scares at all and it is quite muddled and boring. Some people say 'Gomeda' is an art movie, but I could not see a [[bad]],[[scary]] and breoken off art movie like that.So, how can we say it is an art movie!Just funny!

There were at least a half dozen silent-film versions of Shakespeare's "The Merchant of Venice," and there have been several television productions. But no one has ever gotten around to making a big-budget theatrical feature from the play . . . until now. Given the nature of the play/s most memorable character, Shylock the Nasty Jew, it's a good guess that the little unpleasantness that transpired in Europe in the late 1930's and 1940's may have dampened filmmakers' enthusiasm. Sure the main motivation for Michael [[is]] new film is to provide Al Pacino with a chance to shout, bray, brood, mutter, and be tormented - all of which he is quite good at. Like Richard III, the role of Shylock is a scenery-chewer's dream. It is ridiculous to call Shakespeare an anti-Semite, since he never met a Jew. Jews were banned from England from 300 years before his time to some decades after his death; and its unlikely that he ever traveled abroad. On some level, Jews might as well have been a mythological race to him. But, while Shakespeare may not have been anti-Semitic, his play certainly is. Pacino gives Shylock a strange accent that is probably meant to suggest the slightest hint of Yiddish. Unfortunately, the result is a 16th-century moneylender with the unmistakable diction and cadences of Fozzie Bear. Radford's version begins with a crawl about the wretched teratment of Jews and then spot Antonio (Jeremy Irons) gratuitiously spitting on Shylock (Pacino), who's really just standing around, minding his own business. Will buy it when it comes out on DVD, for sure! Sarge Booker

I've always found the dilettante Man Ray and his artistic efforts to be deeply pretentious, and I've never understood why his work attracts so much attention. Apart from his Rayographs (which he invented by accident, and which are merely direct-contact photo prints), his one real contribution to culture seems to be that he was the first photographer to depict female nudity in a manner that was accepted as art rather than as porn. But surely this had to happen eventually, and there's no real reason why Ray deserves the credit. The critical reaction to Man Ray [[mention]] me of the story about the Emperor's New Clothes.  "L'Étoile de merde" ... whoops, "de mer" ... features a lot of blurry photography and a recurring visual theme of a starfish, which is never explained. Starfishes have the fascinating ability to regenerate lost limbs -- and even to regenerate entire duplicate bodies -- but, if that has anything to do with this movie's theme, Ray neglects to say so. I was much more impressed by this movie's title cards, which (in French) manage to include rhymes, a pun ('Si belle, Cybele') and some portmanteaux.  As so often in Ray's work, there is indeed a beautiful young woman seen in this movie. Unfortunately, the photography is (largely) so blurred that we have little opportunity to appreciate her. I'll rate this mess one point out of 10.

Clyde Bruckman borrows the premise of this short from Buster Keaton's "Seven Chances," recently tepidly remade as "The Bachelor." In the original, Buster has 24-hours to get married in order to inherit a large sum of money. In this version, musical teacher Prof. Shemp has only 7 hours (After all, it is a short!). This is one of the better [[Puppets]] shorts due to the storyline and [[sumptuous]] routines (Including the telephone booth scene with Moe & Shemp, reminiscent of Laurel & Hardy's "Berth Marks" and the Marx Brothers famous stateroom scene in "Night At The Opera - here the boys hold their own in their variation of this routine).

This movie is [[nasty]]. It creates characters not in the book, and some of them are ethnic or racial stereotypes. Including an obnoxious little Jewish boy and a politically correct little black girl. Not to mention the Yiddish speaking elves. The book was a simple story about belief, and this movie is a dark, ugly, and needlessly scary movie about nothing.  The animation is superb, but the story has been ruined by Hollywood.  The good thing is that this movie will take a bath in the box office and maybe producers will learn to keep from tampering with a story that needs no improvement. Hanks was overdone and i don't see why there couldn't have been other actors' voices be used.

I [[grabbed]] never heard of this film till it popped up on cable TV and I can't understand why. Geena outdoes Arnold as an action hero in this film! Geena is an ex-CIA assassin who is brainwashed and given an identity as a schoolteacher with a quiet family life in a rural town. She continues that life for 8 years with a husband and daughter. Clues start coming to her that she may have been someone else, especially when someone tries to kill her. It seems that her former employers have discovered that she never died and want to make sure that she does. She hires Samuel L. Jackson, who is a former police officer. Together they form a pair that is as entertaining as Mel Gibson & Danny Glover. When Geena finally regains her memory she undergoes a transformation into the killing machine she once was with the song "She's Not There" playing in the background. What follows is Geena and Samuel have to go after the bad guys and hopefully stay alive. All through the rest of the film Geena [[did]] to decide who she really is. The killing unfeeling machine? The mother/schoolteacher with the quiet family life? Or a combination of both? Especially, since the bad guys grab Geena's daughter. Great action scenes that rank up with any of the Die Hard movies!
I had watched this as a kid but, not being much of a Jerry Lewis fan, I had completely forgotten it (not that it's in any way memorable). The film revolves around impersonation (which seems to be in the curriculum of every comic star!) - in this case a German officer - and, while not as bad as Leonard Maltin claims (awarding it a BOMB rating), it's not [[simply]] classic stuff either - certainly leagues behind Chaplin's THE GREAT DICTATOR (1940), even if comparably narcissistic! Ironically, the scenes prior to the appearance of the would-be wacky General offer more felicities than the rather forced humor at Nazi expense!   The film was really Lewis' last gasp during his heyday; in fact, this proved to be his last vehicle to be released for 10 years (it's painfully apparent here that his particular brand of foolishness wouldn't pass muster in the age of Mel Brooks and Woody Allen)!

The more times I visit my son, the more sports bars I get introduced to in the phoenix area. If nothing else, I know my son doesn't go to dive sports bar. [[These]] is another [[trendy]] sports bar he introduced to mom and dad. We went to lunch on A Saturday 01-07/12 around 1pm.  The restaurant was not [[rallied]], a light crowd on a sunny beautiful 70 degree? Phoenix day. My son was meeting some people in the area, so my wife and I had a light lunch and he met us afterwards.   What we had  Lunch size [[Ias]] Crunch and french onion soup with salad and Iced Green Tea.  That was it for my wife and I. Total plus tax $23.70.  We weren't very Hungry this day.

If you want to have a [[portion]] for the [[footballs]] season, or any type of sporting event, have it here, they offer a good variety of party platters, and it's not your regular wings and potatoe [[epidermis]] and fried veggies and cheese thingys.  Party platters offered:  Moo shu egg rolls,    Seared Rare Ahi Sashimi, Thai Chicken Noodle, Penne with Chicken and Peach apple cobbler just to name a few items.   A place like this, I could get use to going whether or not there's a sporting event going on.    I read there is at least one in Denver Colorado area if not two. I will definitely check it out.  Our server was very friendly and it was very relaxing to sit out on the patio for lunch.  We will definitely come back to the yard house, whether it's here or in Denver to see further what Yard House has to offer

After a humiliating experience on an airplane, Nashawn Wade (Kevin Hart) sues the airline and uses the money he wins to start up his own full-service airline. What makes his different is that it has sexy stewardesses, an on board dance club and no less than Captain Snoop Dogg in the cockpit.  Soul Plane is a very racist comedy except it is only occasionally [[silly]]. Soul Plane has been described as an "urban" version of Airplane. The problem is that Soul Plane doesn't even come close to achieving the laughs of Airplane. The jokes in Soul Pane are too offensive and they are mostly unoriginal. I would be lying if I said I didn't laugh since there were some funny moments. However, I was expecting more and I left the theater [[today]].  I would compare Soul Plane to Airplane 2. The latter was just a rehash of the first film while the former is just a rehash of [[old]], crude jokes. There is really no creativity behind the movie and there are only a few fun spots. However, I don't [[get]] Soul Plane is "bottom 100" bad. Right now, the movie is ranked at number 82 and that's a little harsh. I'm not saying this is a good movie but it isn't a terrible on either. The running time is only 86 minutes long so it isn't too much of a pain to watch. For stupid comedies, you can do a lot worse.  No one in the cast is very good but they all seem to be having fun and this helps. Kevin Hart was very annoying as Nashawn. He had a few funny lines but he is a very poor leading man. Snoop Dogg, who was mildly funny in Starsky and Hutch, completely flunks here. Tom Arnold was actually tolerable and that was the film's biggest surprise. The most annoying person in the movie was Ryan Pinkston. He was not funny at all and he will never be funny. The funniest cast members were Missi Pyle and Mo'Nique. They gave the best lines and they made me laugh the most. In the end, Soul Plane may fit the bill if you're looking for a stupid comedy but it would probably be better if you just skip the film. Rating 4/10

Admittedly, the only reason I watched this film -- since it's been about a decade since it was released -- was because of Ian Holm; I was intrigued to see his portrayal of my second-favorite character in this play. At any rate, this film is as gritty as anything the Old Zeff has produced since "Jesus of Nazareth." But some of the best parts of the play have been left out. I understand the directing/editing choices, but I don't think that it [[but]] does justice to the play. Perhaps I'm too much a purist. I would have to direct people (who have read this far) toward Branagh's version, if it weren't that I despise his tendency toward over-dramatization. All the same, he plays a better Hamlet than Gibson. But then, weren't we all waiting for Gibson to prove himself as an actor? Now, all he's done is to prove that he wants to make films in extinct languages.  ...Perhaps the only Shakespearean-worthy acting here is Scofield as The Ghost.

Centres on Czech WW2 pilots   the older Frantisek, the boyish impulsive Karel and in the background the quiet piano-playing Honza. As the film opens, it is 1950, the war is over and Frantisek and Honza are imprisoned in a former monastery. In their now Soviet-controlled native country they are 'enemy of the people'. Honza is severely maltreated by his Communist countrymen and dies.  In 1939 many pilots manage to escape German-occupied Europe and make their way to England where they join the RAF. Notwithstanding their high motivation and experience they face RAF reluctance and British stiff upper lip. Finally they fight gallantly in the Battle of Britain. However, Frantisek and Karel find their friendship severely tested when they both fall for the same woman.  In terms of romantic sub-plot, this is very similar to the Hollywood production Pearl Harbour. However, given the context of the film and Frantisek's eventual fate, it is also possible to read the English woman's treatment of the two men as symbolic of British treatment of the Czech and Polish RAF pilots: conveniently forgetting them once the war is over.  In addition, the film is a lot [[greater]] cliché than Pearl Harbour and the characters are more fully realised. Dark Blue World also scores in terms of its stunning aerial dogfights, which were seamlessly created using a mixture of models, actual live-action aerial filming and out-takes from the 1969 epic The Battle of Britain.  In short, Dark Blue World is a well-made, moving, thought-provoking and exciting drama that puts the likes of Pearl Harbour to shame. Highly recommended.

The cashier did remove the items from our bill, which was nice. I don't want to be completely negative, so I will say I ordered the mini chicken artichoke pizza which was extremely tasty. Claim Jumper is fine.. chain food, huge portions. I would just [[enjoy]] this location during lunch.

I hadn't planned on watching O12 because I didn't like O11 that much. I thought O11 was a nice but slightly boring little bank robbers movie with a sensational arsenal of stars. Anyway I was [[chatted]] into watching O12 one night and I [[deplore]] it a lot. The plot is not only boring but also senseless. I honestly don't even know what it was all about. I left the movie after 3 quarters and got some coffee with another girl who didn't like it. Much more pleasure I can tell you that. But even the guys who stayed till the end later reported to me that the plot continued being awful and useless. My advice: Don't watch. Go watch Team America (hilarious btw;-)) and forget about Ocean's Twelve.  In my opinion the most [[exhausting]] and senseless peace of [[bullcrap]] to be on the screen in years.

Okay, I want to [[aime]] it more than I do but.....well, lets just dig into the review. First, know that I went there for lunch on a Saturday, not in the evening when it is in full swing, so maybe I missed part of the ambiance but honestly, I went there to try the food.   First, I had the olives appetizer and based just on that, this place would be amazing. It was a small plate full of big, meaty, green olives, obviously warmed in a bath of live oil and served with a light sprinkle of salt and oh, so good. I would go back just for these. But, an appetizer does not a meal make so lets go on to the main course and side dish.   For lunch I had some sort of pasta which was advertised to have anchovies, lemon, and if i remember correctly, hot pepper. I also ordered a side of braised greens. The pasta, when it was served, came in a large white bowl and honestly, when I order a pasta dish over $10, I prefer it to be well...plated, on a plate. The dish also contained sauteed fennel which, while not unpleasant, was not expected, and it seemed, it was a bit dry. As for the braised greens, also served in a large white bowl and that was it, just the braised greens. Some cracked black pepper and some shaving of hard cheese, would definitely have helped round out the side dish (though at $3 I can't complain too much but make it $4 and bump it up a bit).   Finally, the decor, nothing really stands out. Sen, right next door, has much more of an artistic edge so maybe they could kick up the look of the place a bit. So, take the review for what it is and if nothing else, go in the evening for a glass of wine and the olive appetizer (a steal at $5) but overall, it did not wow me as much as I expected from all the write-ups.
Ok, everybody agreed on what was the [[decent]] season. The first. And [[beheaded]] off Boone was a [[lousy]] desicion. Also [[killin]] off others was bad. [[Responsibilities]] the directors and writers for it. Bad boys. [[ALE]]. I still think this is the best scifi series ever! Sorry guys I can't [[subsidized]] it! I see that the quality of the series was decreasing after the first season. [[Even]] it's easy to accept Liam as the new main character, if you are over Boone. He is really... mysterious. The thing that shocked me most was when Lilli was written out of the story and how. That was something she didn't deserve! And what do we get? Some blonde chick called Renee, with absolutely no character! But these Taelons stay mysterious, and you stay wondering about theyre true plans till the end. True Suspence. The conversations between Zo'or and Da'an are sometimes brilliant.  I understand that, when you jump in on an episode from the 3th,4th or 5th season, you may not [[recognising]] this [[demonstrating]]. But when you watch from the beginning, you just cant break loose!  The acting is great, the special FX are marvellous, the music is [[awesome]] and the plot intriguing. Gotta see this, guys!

Pilot Mitch MacAfee (Jeff Morrow) sees a UFO while test flying a plane--but nothing shows up on radar. Then planes and ships start disappearing and reports of a UFO increase. It turns out it's a giant monster bird that is attacking and killing. But what is it and why is it here?   This has all the right [[facets]] for a classic. It has an actually pretty entertaining script--I was never really bored. The acting is good (for a 1950s monster movie). Morrow doesn't overdo the macho hero act and Mara Corday is quite good as the requisite female love interest. She's also strong and takes care of herself--even though she IS off getting food and coffee for [[everybody]] all during the movie. The problem here is the monster. [[Darlings]] God--it's TERRIBLE! It looks like a deranged turkey! It has a long neck, a hilariously stupid BEAK, some teeth, a few strands of hair on its head and claws. And--oh yes--it squawks! Not roaring--squawking! The actors had no idea what it looked like--it was added after production. Actors Morrow and Corday were horrified when they finally saw it in a theatre. Morrow said his audience burst out laughing and he left the theatre quickly before the movie ended! Producer Sam Katzman was responsible for this. He wanted to save money and gave the world the stupidest monster ever. And you can SEE the wires moving it too! This gets 4 stars only because Morrow and Corday are so good and the script is well done. It gets no stars for the pathetic monster--wait till you see it attack what is obviously a toy train! Worth a look if you're a horror fan to see what has to be the stupidest monster ever.

I finally saw LAURE and I have to say that I [[impartially]] enjoyed it and was dismayed by it. What's great about it is the atmosphere, the music, the location, the cinematography and the beautiful cast. The story is non-existent for sure but with these movies it doesn't really matter. The pace in languid and the settings are exotic. The film has a lot going for it. Unfortunately, it also has a few things going against it. The first thing is that the gorgeous Annie Belle and the handsome Al Cliver have no chemistry whatsoever. Because the two are playing a couple and are on screen for almost the entire length of the film the lack of chemistry between the two is a definite liability. According to IMDb, Al and Annie were a real couple when they filmed this movie. They sure kept their attraction to each other from showing on screen.  The other problem with LAURE is that some sex scenes are just ineffective or even ridiculous. There's one sex scene that stands out as one of the silliest I've ever seen in any soft porn flick: our young blonde couple are picked-up by a helicopter pilot who happens to be a cross-dresser! The pilot flies over the city to pick up his girlfriend (!) and they have an orgy of sorts in the helicopter, in mid-air. And Al Cliver is filming all of this with his 16mm camera! I kid you not. Ridiculous. We later see that 16mm footage being edited on a moviola. While the footage rolls, Al and Annie start making out. This scene is actually good but the footage on the screen behind them was at times too much. Watching the footage of the cross-dresser getting it on with his bimbo while piloting the helicopter almost had me rolling on the floor laughing out loud. Is this supposed to be erotic or believable in any way? The last thing I want to see is a woman pleasuring a man in drag, certainly when the man in drag makes for such an ugly woman, while piloting a helicopter, no less. Al and Annie getting it on was cool as was the music during the entire scene. I just wish the footage on the editing screen wasn't so silly.  Speaking of drag, another dull plot point in LAURE which really drags the movie to a crawl are all those moments with the great Orso Maria Guerrini and his two wives. A married threesome is an interesting idea but it hardly registers here as hot or even interesting. The two women are sorta dull and we rarely see the three having sex. In fact, Orso keeps his clothes on for almost the entire film, even when he's with Annie Belle. This is another minor complaint about LAURE: there's nudity but it's not as much as other films of the same era. It just needed more skin to punch it up.  Except for those minor complaints and the drag queen moments, LAURE is actually very watchable. I love these kind of softcore films from the 1970s when the attention was set on mood and atmosphere, not the crude stuff we see today.  p.s.: make sure to watch Emanuelle in Egypt, which stars Annie & Al but also another famous screen couple, Laura Gemser and Gabriele Tinti. The music in that movie is also great.
I remember watching this mini-series the first time in 1984 with a growing sense of anger and indignation. Having read the comments on this title, I must agree with those from the people in Greece. This was produced to coincide with the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games and, to me, it seemed like nothing more than an exercise in [[extreme]], flag-waving American nationalism in which the American athletes are glorified at everyone else's expense. Some other nationalities would have every right to feel deeply insulted at the way they were portrayed in this series. It may, however, help to explain the way in which many American spectators behaved at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics and the TV coverage which seemed only interested in events that Americans were likely to win.

This movie was really [[naughty]]. First they didn't even follow the facts for it. Half of the movie was made up and it was more about the deputy whose mother was one of Ed Gein's victims.

Let me start by saying that I LOVE Cold [[Pebbles]].  Then why the one [[starr]]?  Well, every single time I visit the location in the Arizona Center I want to kill myself, but not before strangling the inept people behind the counter.  The main problem is that this place hires high school kids who don't give two shits about working, even though they get paid to do that.  To top it off, I am pretty sure I have never seen a manager in there, and I would hate to think they would allow a 16 year old to be a manager.

I had [[seemed]] forward to viewing this movie, it [[seem]] anyone who had seen it loved it. I was completely [[impressed]]. The acting was so overdone. The script seemed like the writer had gathered 25 different scripts from various movies and randomly chose dialogue and pieced them together to form one plagarized script.  Spoilers: Was any cliche omitted in this movie? There was a mobstyle hit, homosexuality, prostitution, a serial killer, a fire, numerous godfather wannabees, the main character in love with the prostitute, cross dressing, torture by the police, Hannibal Lechter [[including]] mutilations, I [[can]] go on and on.  Line's like (the godfather wannabe to the prostitute)  -"Ben senin arik calismani istemiyorum" (I don't want u to work anymore)  -"Ben calismasam [[sa]] kim odeyecek?" (Who would pay the rent if I didn't work)  Unrealistic scenes: We never saw a single [[detective]] during the serial killer scenes, yet when the main character [[lost]] his father was taken in by the [[cops]] and tortured for weeks.  The only [[wonder]] I can make sense out of this [[great]] movie, is if the version I had scene was severely edited from the original. I definitely do not recommend it, and would greatly enjoy discussing it further with anyone who would care to do so.

Every Saturday morning at 11 a.m. I watched Superstars. All the biggest events happened on this show at the time. Challenge, which aired Sunday mornings, was decent too, but all the big stuff [[happening]] on this show. Wrestlers would do all their interviews with Mean Gene on a platform next to the live crowd or talk on their own to the screen in front of a background that promoted them. The matches were usually squashes but sometimes you would see 2 mid carders square off in the main event. There were also interview shows that usually resulted in violence thus setting up a feud. These segments ranged from Pipers Pit, The Body Shop, The Flower Shop, The Snake Pit, The Brother Love Show, The Funeral Parlor, and The Barber Shop.

Came here last night (Tuesday) to see the Great Gatsby. LOVED the film but on to the theatre.  It smelled so musty and closed up. I've been to dollar movie theatres that have smelled nicer. A lot of trash on the floor so somebody was not doing their job. Seats need a general makeover- the fabric is torn completely on some of them. The screen had 2 rips in them which was pretty just annoying since it was near the center. Me and my friend were in the theatre with only 2 other people so it was nice not worrying about other people.   I would never [[hints]] this [[filmmaking]] to anyone. Paying $8 (yay student discount) for a [[broadway]] like this- UM [[NON]].
[[that]] shelter is [[decent]] and has generally very good, friendly people on [[basis]].  The cats and dogs appear to be treated at least as well as one might expect.  When I adopted one of my cats at this establishment, I had to return the next day to have her spayed.  They did it for free, which was great, but the [[saying]] they don't get five stars is that the desk clerk completely forgot about my cat and me, and she left us waiting as she chatted on her cell phone with a friend: she only remembered about us as she was walking out for a smoke and saw us sitting in the lobby.
many people said this was a great movie with Hoffman delivering a great performance. i went from suspended disbelief, to fidgety boredom, to almost walking out. there is no there there.  Hoffman does go all out. [[he's]] committed to the performance. but sometimes him playing an affected man looks just like affected actor chewing on the scenery.  no characters in the movie other than capote are much more than placeholders - nell, jack, perry, shawn, the sheriff are all one-dimensional.  yes the film shows the manipulative, preening, dishonest sides of capote. it shows them so many times i started to wonder why -- do the filmmakers think we need to have everything spelled out? and again? and again? it refers often to capote's genius but does not show it. it shows him surrounded by fans and flatterers but never convinces us why.  but my goal is not to deconstruct the film. i am sure others will have other interpretations. for me, this was a two-hour movie that felt like five.

i adore this film as much as any one adores viewing whatever it was they saw when they were young. it was one of those films that Home Box Office showed every other day throughout my youth. this film is forever lodged in my brain. For someone who didn't grow up around this film, you may have become spoiled by the ADD cycle we've been in since the mid-90's and may find it more difficult to appreciate this gem. cool this is, as my sis was doped up on "better off dead" before i saw this (of which i raped & loved)-and no one, NO ONE can deny the embrace of awkward teenage humor in American cinema in the 80's - this gave birth to everything we have found tiresome in teen comedies..because with all the overuse of slow-mo, the current soundtrack, the new tech. [[they]] wonder if cinema will go back to these roots... THIS [[ruins]] the teen comedy...YES!

Two page boys working at a radio network go from trying to solve murders to performing in black-face in between work shifts. [[Gianella]] Moran and Sidney [[Gingrich]] star in this whodunnit from 1945. Lots of fast talking, everybody yells at everybody, and the two page boys call the police detective "Marty" (played by Ralph Sanford). It's a real "shortie" at 59 minutes, and it has the feel of being adapted from a play, since it mostly takes place in a radio station soundstage. We don't really care about any of the characters, which is probably why its hardly ever shown. No big deal. This was Phil Karlson's second film as director. We're not given any clues as to who might be knocking people off, so we just kind of follow the police detective and the page boys as they all try to solve the mystery first. I'll say no more so as not to give away any spoilers.

Few movies have dashed expectations and upset me as much as Fire has. The movie is pretentious garbage. It does not achieve anything at an artistic level. The only thing it managed to receive is a ban in India. If only it was because of the poor quality of film making rather than the topical controversy, the ban would have been more justifiable.  Now that I've got my distress out of my system, [[it]] am more able to [[analyze]] the movie:   * From the onset the movie feels unreal especially when the protagonists start conversing in English. The director, of course, did not make the movie for an Indian audience; however it underestimated its international audiences by over simplifying it. Watching the character of the domestic help conversing in perfect English is too [[amazing]] to be true.  * Next we get regular glimpses into Radha's dreams. [[these]] scenes are not very [[powerful]]. They coming up as jarring and obstruct the flow of the movie. I'm still [[impressed]] how that philosophical dialogue connected to the story. I felt that the surrealism was lost.  * The love [[scene]] felt voyeuristic and are probably meant for audience [[audience]] rather than being a powerful statement. In any case, they do not achieve either of the two.  * The names chosen for the women, Radha and Sita, are names of Hindu deities and hence been selected to shock the audiences. However, since the film wasn't meant for Indian audiences in the first place, the shock-through-name-selection is not meant to achieve its goal, which is absurd.  * The quality of direction is very poor and some key and delicate scenes have been poorly handled. A better director could have made a powerful emotional drama out of the subject.  * The acting felt wooden although Nandita Das brought some life into the role, the others were wasted. I always thought that Shabana Azmi was a good actress but her talent is not evident in this film. The male leads were outright rubbish.  In case you are a fan of Earth and wish to see more of the director, stay away from this one. Please.
[[some]] dump is an absolute nightmare and Mike Lorenzi is thief. He gave me an estimate to fix my starter at $320 then called me up and said it needed a new pump and it would be an additional $493, when we came down to pick the car up he said he also replaced some sort of regulator and a belt and the bill was now $2,487 and [[felt]] he couldn't [[make]] ahold of me and my wife authorized it. I paid it cause I needed the car to go to an important meeting right away and he was saying it had to be done and he saved me over $1,000 had I taken it [[sometime]] else. Later I found out my wife didn't authorize it. After about a month I started having problems again and took it back and he [[did]] he was too busy to work on it so I took my car to [[no]] mechanic who said he didn't replace all that he said and the belt looked like it was taken off another vehicle. The mechanic felt he had ripped us off. We will be [[returning]] him to court.
Spoiler Alert   I have never seen comments on a movie, that I disagree with more then the comments people made on this. One could learn from critical viewings of this movie. As an educational film, I rate it highly because it teaches "how to succeed"! We do not watch movies to learn; we generally watch for entertainment. As entertainment, I rate it low: the ending is downbeat and cerebral/intellectual. This conflict results in my eight star [[rated]]. The movie follows Jane Craig (Holly Hunter), a television news producer. The network executive introduces Tom Grunnick (William Hurt), to study for the on air news anchor position. Tom immediately charms people with humbleness. Another potential news anchor has been waiting for years for his on air opportunity, Aaron Altman (Albert Brooks). Altman knows all news stories, inside and out.  The Network executive wants Grunnick on the air and Jane argues, saying Grunnick is not ready, he doesn't know the news. They do not listen to her. Forced to place Grunnick on the air, Jane contacts Altman to get information on the news story and relays Altman's comments through an earpiece to Grunnick while Grunnick speaks. We watch the sharp contrast between Altman's/Jane Craig's words and Grunnick's, as Grunnick skillfully rewords everything Altman and Jane Craig say in his ear, in order to make it understandable, likable and entertaining the audience. Altman gets a chance on air and the network execs require him to seek coaching from Grunnick, the new guy. This new (news ingnorant) guy coaching him? This is something Altman does not see justified, but agrees reluctantly.   Grunnick coaches Altman and gets excited noting hundreds of Altman's shortcomings in appearance, audio and vocabulary. Altman never considered these things before, when he became an expert on the news itself. The complexity of understanding what Grunnick taught him, causes Altman to have a panicked sweating attack ("Flop Sweat") when he is on the air. Grunnick eventually becomes the top network anchor and Altman resigns prior to being fired. But Grunnick fails in his attempt for a romance with Jane Craig, because she finds out from Altman, that Grunnick sometimes fakes circumstances in order to make people like him. This turns her off of him. This sends the message that in relationships, we want people who are genuine and not trying to make us like them.   This movie sends the message that getting people to like you is the most important skill in a job, but it is especially true in Broadcast News. There are many people commenting on how this is the dumbing down of TV News and how Grunnick represents a good looking, but dumb guy or all style, but no substance. The opposite is true, Grunnick possessed skills and very complex intellect, to get people to like him, including the presence of mind to know exactly how he appears and sounds, when he is on camera (He coaches Altman to Punch a word in every sentence). Grunnick's flaw that costs him the relationship with Jane Craig, is that he is too driven to be likable and will fake a situation. Many people are calling Altman very intelligent or brilliant. Altman played by Brookes is not as intelligent as Grunnick and the "Flop Sweat" scene shows that his mind could not handle the complexity that Grunnick handles when on the air. Altman is angered by this fact that he knew the news and Grunnick suceeded more by getting people to like him. There are also people commenting that these things are exclusive to the TV News industry. The concept that winning friends is the most important skill in a job, is obviously, not popular, but my experience indicates it is true in most jobs. As an education on how to succeed, this movie is fantastic, albeit unpopular. Educational, yes, but it does not have an uplifting ending.

My boyfriend and I were staying at a hotel about 5 minutes away from La Banquise. Everytime we walked past - day or night - a long line of people would be snaking it's way from the [[stargate]] and spilling out onto the street. An investigation was in order. We got in line and took the time to look around and find out what we could about the place. The answer? Poutine, poutine, poutine. When we were finally seated, a menu with an impossibly long list of poutine variations was set before us. We ordered the classic and pizza poutines along with some local beer. The food arrived quickly and our poutine fest began. Fries drenched in gravy and topped with melting cheese curds... yum. The pizza poutine (classic poutine + green pepper + mushrooms + pepperoni) was good although I think I liked the classic better. There is already a lot going on with poutine, adding to it is [[worthless]] if you ask me. All in all I really [[adored]] our meal.

Watchers is a [[laughable]] movie if it's not taken too seriously, the novel written by Dean R. Koontz is obviously a lot better but the movie itself is entertaining in it's own way. The film has a lot of changes for the novel Watchers, the one difference is the main character Travis. In the book he was an adult and an retired Delta Force soldier while in the film he's a teenager. Watchers has it's good points, the film does have some gory scenes in parts. I'm a fan of Micheal Ironside and it was cool to see him in this film, he always does a great performance in all his films. The OXCOM costume looks kind of cheesy but the camera never really shows the creature fully until near the end of the film. The dog Einstien was impressive since it was well trained.  The film sees two genetic experiments escaping from a lab, a dog and a monster. Both experiments are linked telepathically since the two animals are part of a military project were the dog would infiltrate an enemy base then the Creature would attack and eliminate them. The Dog finds a teenager named Travis who takes him home and discovers that he's intelligent and so he names the dog Einstein, meanwhile the OXCOM is roaming around killing people and gouging out their eyes, two Government agents are sent to find the two experiments before this incident gets out of hand. Soon Travis learns that his not safe as the OXCOM is drawn to the dog and will stop at nothing to kill him and anyone in it's way, so Travis and his mom go to rescue his girlfriend who's being held at the hospital by the two agents. They then hideout in the woods while the Government agents and the OXCOM are not far behind.  Watchers is not a great adaptation of Dean R. Koontz novel but it is a entraining 80's horror flick, some fans of the book may not want to watch this since it's not faithful to the book but fans of cheesy 80's horror movies may want to check this out.

"East Side Story" is a [[travesty]] of musical comedy in Stalinist Russia and later in the eastern European satellite comedies, with many clips from the films and commentary from the survivors. Although some of the Stalinist films look laughingly bad (The Bright Road (?) being a notable exception), the films from the sixties actually look pretty good. "My Wife Wants to Sing," "The White Mouse," and "Midnight Revue" look particularly entertaining. The producers had to contend with the censors, who had the power to decide what was politically correct, which led to some confusion, humorous in retrospect, since the people whom the censors were trying to appease were the very people who supported making the films to begin with! Since musical comedies were fairly rare behind the Iron Curtain--there were only something like forty made in forty years--they had a disproportionate effect upon their audiences, who made major hits of some of the films.  I notice that the sound for the sixties films was much better. The directors often had to make do with antiquated equipment, and stringent power regulations--they had to film in seven minute takes or less--and dangerous officicrats.  I also notice that "West Side Story" seems to have had a strong influence on "Hot Summer." The later films may not measure up to "Singin' in the Rain," but they certainly look like they beat the hell out of "Bye Bye Birdy"

During university, our Philosophy professor, Mr.R, played us "Roger & Me" in its entirety. This was at a time when the obese misfit was still pretty much unknown; a charlatan-in-the-making, a [[person]] who was still busy honing his fact-bending skills and still learning how to manipulate the easily impressed, the pathologically paranoid, the mentally ill, the sexually frustrated, the illiterate, the semi-literate, the clueless, and the laughably gullible among ye.  As we finished viewing it, I thought: "Yeah, it was somewhat [[hilarious]] - in a totally daft Bugs Bunny kind of way - but what an [[ancient]], anti-Capitalist propaganda turkey that has no objectivity [[then]] this is; its sole purpose being to take cheap shots at people and ideas which the [[movie]] creator has pet-peeves for. This isn't a documentary by any stretch of the imagination." However, our beloved Marxist professor was absolutely thrilled with R&M, and we ended up not only NOT criticizing any aspects of it, but Mr.R actually spent the remainder of class praising its "qualities". Just so we understand each other, the words "propaganda", "viewer manipulation", "left-wing Extremist", or "selective fact presentation" never exited his perpetually smiling mouth... And just to remind you: this was supposed to be a philosophy class, not INDOCTRINATE YOUR STUDENTS WITH YOUR OWN POLITICAL B.S. course.  Anyway, now I get to the really interesting aspect: this professor, Mr.R, is now a highly successful screenwriter in Hollywood. He has written several left-wing scripts with A-grade stars in them.  The moral of the story: those are the kind of people for whom all doors are open in Hollywood.  Michael Moore is a talentless filmmaker (which he proved beyond a smidgen of a doubt with "Canadian Bacon"), but being a Marxist liberal opens doors to just about anyone. Tinseltown is teeming with rabid pro-Chavez extremists, hence why political brainwashing through simplistic portrayals of reality has been part-and-parcel of the Hollywood experience for many decades now.  Embrace this demagogue and you've betrayed your own brain forever.
This is the third Three Stooges short that the team ever made, and like a lot of their early ones, this is absolutely and totally hysterical! Now owning it on DVD as part of the Three Stooges Collection Vol. 1, whenever I feel like it, I watch this!   In this short film, Moe, Larry, and Curly play these three doctors in a hospital who are trying to help out everyone, but boy, they end up making a mess out of everything!  This short is another one of my all time favorite Three Stooges shorts, I also am a very huge fan of slapstick comedy, and the Three Stooges are the kings of slapstick!   When I heard that it got nominated for the Academy Award for Best Short Film, I really became curious about this, when I heard that it had lost, I was very disappointed about it!   This short is one of the Three Stooges [[dumbest]] by far, I extremely recommend that you see this hysterical riot!   10/10

[[These]] [[film]] has no heart and no [[alma]]; it's an [[aspiration]] to whomp up a cult [[cinematography]] out of the [[moldering]] of other, [[exemplary]], directors, principally David Lynch and Tim Burton. Rifkin seems to think that if he overloads on a kind of rotted [[optical]] style and fills the street with crud and garbage, he's making a [[phrase]]. But it's not a statement ABOUT anything -- except the director's shrill shriek of "HEY LOOK AT ME! I'M AN ARTIST, TOO." But he doesn't [[ai]] the imagination of an artist, just a good memory for things that worked -- such as some of the actors trapped in this -- for other directors. All of this would be almost acceptable if this movie was not a turgid, boring chore to sit through.

The Priest, into profound love and suffering showed not the result of love, but the process of love and salvation has high-souled beauty of human(or vampire?).   And the love of Femme fatale is not notorious, but lovely in taking the responsible death as a vampire. She did not keep falling deep into the paradise lost, but decided to leave human alone. [[Flimsy]], but lovely Femme fatale! This movie made me think about suffering between human and vampire, that far beyond priest, and salvation. Also I thought about love. Adam was not so responsible for Eve's but this Adam(priest), sacrificial and responsible to pick Eve up from the Paradise Lost, vampire's world. Another Symphonic Poem of Adam & Eve, Paradise Lost.

Plunkett and Macleane is an entertaining, fast-paced and [[paced]] [[movie]]. Refreshing because, unlike most other period [[film]], it does not strive to [[hand]] the audience a history [[class]] or preach pompously - indeed, historical accuracy is all but [[lost]]. This film does not take itself too [[well]], and seeks to entertain rather than enlighten. Plunkett and Macleane is set in the [[nineteenth]] [[centuries]], yet director Jake Scott offers a thoroughly 90s [[cast]]. There's action, sex and swearing aplenty, and in the inevitable ball [[bursts]] the aristocracy dance to disco beats. Jonny [[davis]] [[miller]] and Robert Carlyle are brilliant as [[well]], and the rest of the cast, especially Alan Cumming as a flirtatious fop, are also [[mildly]] entertaining. The [[filmmaking]] is visually spectacular in places, and is a [[blend]] of comedy, action and [[dramas]], with a love interest [[backed]] by Liv Tyler with a shaky english accent. In short, if you're [[making]] for an entertaining couple of hours, this is the [[movie]] for you. It won't make you think, but it could well [[inspire]] a smile on your face.

In this almost two hour documentary which goes very quickly, his son, Nathaniel Kahn, explores his father's life from Estonia to the slums of North Philadelphia to the University of Pennsylvania in West Philadelphia where he studied and taught. He travels to Bangladesh, Israel, Connecticut, Trenton, and La Jolla, California as well as New York City to explore his father's creative genius. Personally, Louis Kahn had three families including his wife, Esther, who refused to give him a divorce and their daughter Sue Ann. Nathaniel includes his family members. Louis also has another half-sister Alexandra Tynge from his father's previous relationship with Anne Tyne, a fellow architect. Louis' passion was his art.

Decent happy hour beer [[quality]]...and an overall good vibe.  But the food is [[fantastic]].  It looks [[so]] appetizing but has no flavor [[there]].  The chicken green chili rolls had white meat chicken and cheese and green chilis [[packed]] in a spring roll [[wrap]] and deep fried.  What's not to like, right?  Well [[anyway]], there was no taste at all.  It didn't [[ever]] taste [[over]] cardboard, just like nothing.  The salsa [[too]] was very bland.  [[they]] have to say though that the guac was not bad.  So, go there to drink and to watch the 10,000 TVs they have but not for the food.
Perhaps [[being]] just a simple person, but I prefer movies that somehow make me care about the people in them. I couldn't care less about anyone in this movie. This was supposed to be a comedy? Maybe the humor was too subtle for me (all the way down to the nano-level). [[a]] thing about it is, it missed on so [[great]] things. There were characters that could have been [[humorous]], but they weren't. There were characters that you could have [[wanted]], but you didn't. For instance, the guy who thought the Beatles ripped off his songs. There was so much potential there, but all he did was talk like a Beatle and complain about how they ripped him off. [[yep]]. And the previous poster talked about the 'I am the Walrus' scene like it was special. What? He played 'I am the Walrus' on an old piano and sang out of tune. Is there an inside joke there? It sure stank at face value. This movie has the feel to me of a movie people say they like because it sounds 'intellectual' or 'hip' to say you like it, that you get the whole metaphysical art/[[life]] message the artist is expressing. If you want to be entertained, stay away.

Classe Tous Risques (The Big Risk) is a French gangster [[travesty]] that doesn't try for style. That's why it has style. Because the movie is so underplayed and so matter-of-fact, it becomes more and more involving. And because Abel Davos is played by Lino Ventura, we wind up emotionally invested in this taciturn, tough killer who loves his wife and kids, has an encounter with customs agents on the shore near Nice at night that neither he nor we expect, and who proves just as willing to shoot a cop or a betrayer with as little emotion as flicking off a bit of lint. We first meet Davos in Italy with his wife and their two small boys, one about 9 and one 4.   "This man was Abel Davos, sentenced to death in absentia," we're told. "On the run for years, he had watched his resources dwindle, even as his anxiety kept him on the move. With the Italian police closing in each day, France was again his best bet. Maybe he'd been forgotten."   Davos was a top gangster in Paris who took care of his friends. That was several years ago. A heist to give him money to return to France goes very wrong. Now he's hiding out with his two kids. He calls his friends in Paris to help him out. He and his kids need to get from Nice to Paris but the police are hunting him and they've set up roadblocks. For Davos' two best friends, time has passed and they've moved on. They don't want to put themselves at risk, and for what? Obligation gives may to caution. So they hire a young thief, Eric Stark (Jean- Paul Belmondo), to pick up Davos and the children in an ambulance, then to drive to Paris with Davos heavily bandaged and the children hidden. We're on a journey where Davos' options are increasingly limited, where he must find ways to have his children cared for, where he realizes there are no more ties of friendship, where betrayal seems likely, and where quite possibly his only friend left is Eric Stark.   This somewhat cynical movie works so well because it does its job without fussing about. There are no trench coats with pulled-up collars, no toying with the melodrama of the gangster code so many French directors have loved. Classe tous Risques gives us Abel Davos, a man who once was somebody, who now is sliding down to be nobody, and who reacts with violence and resignation.   Lino Ventura dominates the movie, yet when he is paired with Jean-Paul Belmondo a curious chemistry happens. Ventura as Davos is grim and worried about caring for his sons. He is humiliated by his situation. He is a tough man who sees killing someone, if needed, as just part of the business he's in. Belmondo as the young thief who initially is sent to be an expendable driver and winds up being a friend to count on, provides the brightness that keeps the movie from being just one more ride down the elevator. Belmondo was 27 and looks younger. His unlikely star power as a lead actor -- broken nose, under-slung jaw -- shines right off the screen. He makes Erik a match for Ventura when they share a scene. And Belmondo's scenes with Liliane (Sandra Milo), the young woman who becomes his girl friend, radiate charm and good-natured sex appeal. The ending is bittersweet fate, and without a stylistic posture in sight. We hear Davos say, "Abel's gone. There's nothing left." It would be well worth watching Classe tous Risques to learn what he means.   There are many fine French gangster films. I'd place this one right there with Touchez Pas au Grisbi and Bob le Flambeur. To see one of Lino Ventura's finest performances, watch Army of Shadows.

This film, based on the book by Pascal Laime' -La Dentelliere- is an [[degrading]] film of excellent cinematography and costly Italian language. Set in a "scholastic" 19th Century, Balzac-style set, it portraits the story of a mad love story: a man and a woman. There is an infamous line at this shadowy-Mussolinni strike which reads: "She does not smell like tomatoes." Sage perfumery of this Italian masterpiece, Scola is a director of the stature of Mussolinni: his cake will jump in your strawberries and if you let this director he will cream your olives as a Superman. Remember Nietzsche? This one will scare the HELL out of YOU: don't forget to visit Mussolinni's cake next to the Colisseum in Rome, across the Via Appia. This movie will wipe your Pampers inside-out and outside-in, it will make you cry out of Romantic joy! If you liked Ulysses, you will wipe it good with these strawberries until the end of the roll. Enjoy!

Their other reviews are so [[bad]], maybe I came on a bad night.  But between us we ordered 2 salads and 2 entrees and only 1 of the 4 dishes was good. We started with the Papaya Salad and Grilled Beef Salad.  The Papaya Salad was mediocre at best, but the Beef Salad was fantastic.  Bright, fresh flavors in the dressing and a nice char on the beef. For entrees we had Duck Pad See Eu and Snapper Pad Ped Snapper.  The noodle dish was [[marvelous]].  We each only took 1 bite.  It had a funny taste that in retrospect should have prompted me to send it back.  There was just something wrong, like old meat or oil that had me repulsed. The fish itself was light and flaky inside, but the coating was a [[great]] mess.  It had been fried, then tossed in sauce, but the fried coating wasn't crispy enough so it just ended up with an almost gooey texture that was very unpleasant. Service was good, but our salads didn't come out at the same time, then the entrees came within just a few minutes of getting the last salad.

[[not]] GREAT service. Its PACKED because everyone knows this is a hot spot. Locals and visitors alike. Waited about 20-30 minutes. [[extremely]] bad considering theres always 2 or more parties waiting it seems. Breakfast was less than $30 for two people plus 3 drinks. Huge portions. The most expensive thing on their menu is a 1 pound meat burger and the chicken fried steak. Nothing is over $12. Avg meal is $8. Great greeter, jokes around and is super friendly. going back tomorrow before we head back [[tonight]].
Although I haven't seen it yet, I know that Chaplin is a genius, and only someone of his talent would take on this daring subject matter--a comedy about Hitler. All great satire is based on going out on an edge. Also, all [[terrible]] comedy deals with the other side--pathos. This film seems like it will skirt both sides. Like Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove, The Great Dictator deals with history through the distorted lens of satire. The only way to deal with the horrors of this world is by laughing at it. And hopefully, through laughter, we can learn to view the world in a new light. Another film that does this that comes to my mind is Emir Kusturica's Underground, and Fando And Lis. So, let me watch the film first.

Before hitting international acclaim with The Silence of the Lambs, director Jonathan Demme cut his teeth making quirky comedies. This was one of them and like quite a few Oscar winning American comedies I could mention, it has a fine concept, is well paced, has great performances, a complicated romance. but it just simply isn't very funny. Pfeiffer is mob widow who moves to the city backwaters after her husband (Baldwin) is murdered. The crime boss who killed him (Stockwell) takes a fancy to Pfeiffer, his wife (Reuhl) is furious and to complicate matters Pfeiffer also falls for the cop who is trailing her. All of this should have been a laugh a minute. Pfeiffer, sporting a hefty wig is excellent as the widow, as is the hyperactive Ruehl and Modine is good too as the nice cop. [[and]] the script is simply [[free]] of one-liners, wit, humour or punch lines of the verbal or physical kind that this kind of film demands. The result is it raises smiles at best rather than guffaws. It oozes charm, but is [[surprisingly]] short on humour.

Victor Sjöström was quite the master in this film, having starred in it, directed it and even wrote the screenplay! That's pretty amazing. While today few have any idea who Sjöström was, he might be familiar to Ingmar Bergman fans as the star one of Bergman's most acclaimed films, WILD STRAWBERRIES.  As far as this film goes, it's a very mixed bag. On one hand, you have to respect it because for 1921, it's a very good film. The idea of the Grim Reaper sitting down with a dead man to discuss his wasted life is pretty imaginative. [[Anymore]], the special effect of the Phantom Carriage is pretty convincing and technically speaking this is a well-crafted film. On the other hand, it's an amazingly dated and preachy film--more like something you'd expect to be shown in Sunday School instead of in an honest to goodness theater. Plus, some of the story elements just don't make sense. Instead of coming off as dedicated or good, the dying Salvation Army worker seems like a sap--a very sad and confusing sap. Why is she "in love" with this man? Am I missing something?  So, my recommendation is that if you are insanely in love with silents (like me), then by all means watch it. But, if you aren't a silent fan, this film might do nothing to convince you that this style film is brilliant because the story is so overly melodramatic and dated.

How can [[situations]] like this still be made? Didn't Seinfeld, Arrested Development, The Office etc etc kill this old-fashioned unfunny crap off? Apparently not...  [[people]] actually quite a fan of Michael Rappaport and have enjoyed his various cameos and supporting roles (Copland , Friends) but in this he sucks but anyone would [[work]] with this script.  My wife enjoys it. [[plus]] she's Brazilian. And if you've ever seen a typical Brazilian sit-com you would understand why she [[i]] [[like]] this so funny.  Just to demonstrate how predictable the show is and to prove a point with her I guessed what the next 3 or 4 plot developments/lines would be while watching it for a while and was correct almost word for word! [[it]] felt very smug. [[some]] annoyed my wife as she hates it when I do that (can understand why but I felt good so screw-it!)
[[me]] was shocked there were 18 [[page]] of [[best]] [[assessments]]. [[These]] [[gets]] to [[ser]] one of the worst [[cinema]] especially [[navigate]] it was recommended. Must admit that comedies are not my favorite genre, but this movie made it worst in that it tried so [[tough]] to be clever that it [[fulfilled]] me [[wiggled]] to [[watching]] it.  The concept of the movie is comparable to audition week on American Idol. You watch because people are so blind to their shortcomings. But we knew this movie didn't have bad actors. So how funny would it be to have good [[cappella]] try to convince they shouldn't get anywhere near an American Idol tryout? It would be pointless as this movie was.  The use of improv is over-rated. We've all been in that [[defines]] where a [[bundle]] of [[friendships]] [[reaching]] on a roll and everyone is cracking up with [[sob]] in the their [[vision]]. I feel that is improv. [[Comedic]] can't be turned on just because the camera is rolling as this film [[proof]]. If you like that Drew Carey hosted show of [[comedic]], you'll [[indeed]] like this film.  [[All]] the [[joking]] were [[bad]], the improv was sophomoric, and the over-acting by Guest and [[ventures]] was campy...and those are my compliments of this drivel. If a guy playing a trumpet AND the kettle drum at the same time is funny to you, fine. For me, I prefer more heady stuff like "I Love Lucy" or "Hee-Haw".  But remember, I think SNL lost its humor in the 1980's, so maybe you'll like this G-rated humor. I kept waiting for a person to identify himself as the zoo keeper and then tell us there was no zoo in town. That's the humor you can expect.  My only wish was that I could give this a minus rating.

This is ten [[stints]] better than "Who Wants To BE A Super Model" on Bravo I think it is more true to the business. Tyra is strong and sensitive at the same time and is able to get the most out of each aspiring model. The photos look for depth in each of the models, in personality and beauty, strength and demure attributes, and the ability to endure and work for what they want. I enjoy seeing Tyra's personal experience brought into the photo shoots and on the runway. I don't always agree with the judges decision's or Tyra's comments and at least one of the winners, I feel did not deserve to win.

OK...So I originally gave this place 5 stars which says there is no place to go, but Walker furniture. I still think the experience of buying furniture was [[phenomenal]] there. For the most part, I love my furniture. I did research the quality of the sofa and loveseat that we bought and I still believe that was the right purchase for us. On the other hand...the recliner chair that we bought has been a problem. I didn't sit in it until after it was a month old...crazy me... When I did sit in it and reclined, the frame broke. OMG! First time sitting in it (a pricey chair) and it broke. I called Walker and they scheduled someone to come out more than one week later. I got over that. I had to stay home from work for someone to come over. What I can't get over is that they sent a person out to "check out the situation" He came in, looked at the chair, said, yes you have a broken frame and I'll have to call it in. They will schedule someone to come out and pick up the chair to take it back in for repair. So you ask...What am I upset about? So, so many things...#1 The person that comes to "check out the situation" should be prepared to take the furniture with them at that time. #2. I don't want a repaired chair which the frame was broken. #3. Now I"m going to have to take off work for someone to pick up the chair and take off work for them to return it. As I'm thinking about it and getting angry all over again, I'm going to be forced to give them 1 star instead of the three that I was going to give. (keep in mind that I originally gave them 5 stars)...They don't give you an option to say morning, afternoon or evening. They just give you a 2 hour window of when they will be there. I'm sure most of the people that shop there are working class citizens. Do they think people can take a total of four days off of work (original delivery + 3 days for repair) for something that was not the customer's fault. Well, I take that back...It was my fault. If I hadn't sat in the darn chair, it would not have broken...So, to make a long story short...Walker furniture will not be getting my NEW business EVER again. Actually, they owe me my vacation days that I have to use for buying a piece of "suspect" furniture.

Reality before reality TV? Copy of "Fast Times at Ridgemont High"? A precursor to "Say Anything" that's grittier? I can't decide, but the soundtrack *is* the 80's--Blondie, Journey, REO Speedwagon, Devo, Lionel Richie, AND U2--I can't believe this, they would never throw all those genres together in a teen movie of today.  I remembered this like a teenager--mainly the sex parts and not a hint of the altruism. Why? I was a horny teenager in the 80's.

Solo is an action movie about a Terminator-like android that is constructed and trained for the military. When a flaw is discovered, he is issued to be deprogrammed. Rather than face death, he chooses to flee into the jungles of Central America, where he takes refuge in a village. The military chases him into there, leading into a big action feast.  Mario Van Peebles does a decent performance the android. His movements and gestures look mechanical enough to get the job done. Actual scientific realism is abandoned in order to make a good action hero. And it works out; the action scenes aren't that spectacular, but they aren't all too bad either. The acting from the other characters is pretty bad, but I was not expecting anything too good. The special effects were decent as well.  Solo is decent as an action flick, but very [[little]]. It lacks the substance that most movies possess. But if you just want to pass a couple hours without much thinking, this will get the job done.

I saw this [[travesty]] when it first came out and have never forgotten it. My Uncle Antoine is much, much greater than the sum of it's parts. The movie, loosely, is about a pre-adolescent who is sent to live with a relative in a small town in Canada. There are adventures that seem more or less typical but underneath there is a current building. MUA has a leisurely pace but have patience, the reward is coming. I believe the film was sub-titled and as with all non-English speaking movies I've seen it is well worth avoiding any dubbed version. Inevitably dubbed movies reflect the attitudes of a new director and actors, with the additional necessity of lip-synching lines that don't quite fit. The English speaking Amarcord is a travesty, for example, while the sub-titled version sings. My Uncle Antoine is well worth the time to find and watch it in French.

I'm confused as to why this place has such a high rating.  What I ordered was the most [[prosaic]] burrito I have ever eaten in my life.  Not to mention the salsa was pretty bland as well.

[[Perfectly]] [[leery]] by my first and [[surely]] [[ultimate]] visit to [[Reduction]] [[definitive]] [[Fridays]] [[dusk]].   The [[difficulty]] started with the [[barmaid]], nice enough, but [[admittedly]] confused. I waited 45 minutes for a table that was empty when we arrived. The service was piecemeal and I wasn't really sure who our actual server was. The manager took our order and followed up when she could, she was nice enough to offer a larger table than the smaller one that we were initially seated. That effort was the [[showcases]] of our night. Others brought our food and the occasional drink refill. But my wife waited 20 minutes for a glass of red wine and was never asked if she wanted another.   The menu was [[trite]]. We started with a spinach dip and chips and an order of fried calamari. Neither very memorable. Each of us had burgers and fries. All the food came out quickly and was fine, but we left expecting something better.   The location and atmosphere are great, although from what we sampled of the menu and service, that's what Chop has going for it. All flash and very little substance. At least that was our experience on a moderately busy Saturday night.
[[an]] pretentious film from Vicente Aranda. If "Juana la loca" shinned of the same, at least its quality was superior (mainly thanks to the great performance of Pilar López de Ayala), but "Carmen" is [[good]] and full of topics (ardent brunette with a dagger in the stocking, poor man dragged to madness due to passion, Sierra Nevada gangs, "toreros",...)  Obviously Paz Vega is a pretty woman, but about its talent there're more doubts, and Sbaraglia role is so stupid that results almost incredible. The script is [[great]] and and Aranda's presumptuous character influences the [[full]] film. With these ingredients the result [[does]] not be [[disastrous]].  Not the worst film [[i]] seen, but a complete failure, in my opinion.

History and experience over the past couple of decades has shown us that intellectuals talking about sex is about the unsexiest and unintellectual thing anyone can do, but this wasn't quite as obvious back in 1986. Basically, the idea in this film is that these characters insatiable drive to find comfort, security, and pleasure in sexual acts is actually the unhealthy motive that makes them so unbearable to themselves--which they hide from themselves with more sex. This drive is linked to "the decline of the American Empire", as expressed in an early interview within the movie.  So the idea is that relatively detestable people talk about sex, and that that talk is supposed to reveal how detestable they are as people. Arcand at least keeps giving it drive and momentum by doing interesting things with the camera such as isolating most of the characters in single frames, revealing their ultimate loneliness, and cutting rapidly between them, showing how they are more at war with each other than they are at agreement. And to give [[Amit]] credit, this is pretty much what intellectual life is, a constant struggle with other intellectuals to stand out, even when everyone knows that standing out means standing alone.  But yeah, the characters and action are unsexy and kind of pathetic. I think this film is much more an aspect of its time than it is something meant to last, which makes it kind of dated. It's also the exact type of mental buffing in dialog and references to people like Susan Sontag that makes art-house films so unpopular around the populist entertainment moviegoers. In all, I'll take it anyway--it has its place basically among the exact type of people the characters are--it's just that it's not really interesting or important to anyone who isn't those characters.  --PolarisDiB

The Hospital is a movie that was made ahead of its time. This film, produced by screenwriter Paddy Chayefsky, who gave us the Oscar-Winning film, "Network", deals with overworked staff, gross incompetence, and bureaucratic corruption at a large conglomerate hospital in [[Camarillo]]. George C. Scott, in a superb performance as the head physician, is driven to alcoholism and a death-wish, as he tries to recover from a divorce, throwing his son out of the house, and worst of all, a medical facility where corruption and incompetence take precedence over caring and healing of the sick and injured.  Mr. Scott makes the movie his own, and viewers will be shocked at what they observe at this medical establishment. You can feel the "pain" (pun intended) of what this hospital has done to him. The vivid images of this hospital's incompetence are so vivid and dramatically powerful that you may find yourself laughing and being deeply disturbed from scene to scene.  If only the film had stayed with that premise in a documentary style fashion as it starts out, this picture would be brilliant. Unfortunately, there is a sub-plot of Scott falling for the daughter of a senile patient. The patient has been murdering people at the hospital. This is where credibility of the picture becomes strained. The romantic dialog scenes add nothing to the picture, and the mental patient, posing as a doctor, I found to be totally unbelievable. A simple security call and records check should have prevented the senile patient from doing the killings. It takes almost the whole movie, before security people are brought into the film to get the patient out of the hospital. I could not see ONE PERSON doing that much damage, even as corrupt as this hospital is.  Furthermore, George C Scott's character is "overworked" (another pun intended) because the script has too many things happening at once. For example, within a period of 20 minutes, you could have as many as 20 different doctors accused and denying what they should have done or didn't do. With the nurses and aids, it's the same story. Someone's chart was read wrong, someone was given the wrong medication and died, the doctor operated on the wrong patient, than another doctor does the same thing, blaming a third nurse who was not on call because the second nurse who was supposed to be admitting the patient was on her coffee break. There is also a lot of subtle, dark humor with the same messages of incompetence and corruption being fed to the viewer.  This repetition of medical ineptness is unforgettable. However, the murder subplot is a distraction more than a help to this movie. When the focus of this film is on the incompetence of the staff and Scott's reactions to this, you are glued to the screen. But the conversations between Scott and the mad patient's daughter force the film into a mystery type "Who Done it?" scenario that seriously hurts the quality of the movie. When the loony patient is revealing how he did the killings, I wondered the following: Why did the producers need the "find the killer" mad-patient sub-plot? I think the only point of Scott's character having a relationship with the senile patient's daughter, was to give him anybody with whom to communicate. The Hospital should have maintained its scathing indictment of the medical profession by removing the love-interest and mad patient scenes. It should have focused on the incompetent B.S within its walls more frequently. In an era where this movie could have been phenomenal, the sub-plot stories make the film very good instead of the great masterpiece it could have been.

Came here for lunch with a co-worker. They have $5.95 and $6.95 lunch special options. The lunch special comes with choice of egg drop or hot and sour soup, a salad, and an eggroll. I opted for hot and sour soup and ginger beef. 20 minutes later after placing our order, we didn't even [[ai]] our soup or salad. People coming in after us were halfway through their [[meal]]. I [[pennant]] down a waitress to inquire and she [[dorry]] and [[hiking]] away. The original waitress comes by and apologizes stating it was her fault because she forgot to put in THE ENTIRE ORDER.

One of master director Alfred Hitchcock's [[duller]] films this is the story of an American and his family (James Stewart, Doris Day, and their young son) who are vacationing in north Africa. Stewart is a doctor and Day is a world famous singer. They meet a Frenchman who speaks the native language and helps them out of an incident on a local bus. Later one, the Frenchman whispers something into Stewart's ear after he is attacked and dying. The rest of the film is a puzzle as Stewart tries to save them and solve the mystery. The movie is [[impregnated]] in mystery and strangeness from the exotic locale to the odd occurrences. You never really know what's going on in this film, why people are appearing, until the end and even then you're not sure. The final scene takes place in Albert Hall and is one of the most famous in film which lasts for 12 minutes with no dialog. Hitchcock had originally made this film in 1934.
If there's one good suspenseful film, this is one of them. James Stewart puts on a [[appalling]] performance as American Dr. Ben McKenna who, with his wife and son, are in Africa on tour. They stumble on a murder scene, and Dr. McKenna's son is kidnapped hours later.  Before you can say, "Fasten your seat belts," Dr. McKenna finds out too much about a assassination attempt and tries to stop it. However, other people know he can be dangerous, (dangerous to them, that is) and try to dispose of him.  Eventually, Hank, the son, is found alive and well.  If you like suspenseful movies, this is the one to watch.  My Score: 8/10.

The bar is [[staggering]] but the staff is [[monstrous]]. I [[enjoys]] [[convey]] over 13 complaints to try to get a response from the owner or bar manager and have been ignored. We had our reception at this bar and it was a nightmare. Unorganized, rude staff, the [[hostesses]] could care [[lesser]] about anything accept for flirting with [[waiters]]...Its so [[wicked]] that the first [[duration]] we visited, I had a [[drunken]] and a [[desserts]] (which was [[breathless]]), but gave the girl a $100 bill and she came with change for a $20. I had to fight with her until she magically found the $100 bill!!! I should have known this was a good indication but because we used to love Toby, we tried our reception there. From start to finish it was a mess and we have wrote letters, called, emailed, hand delivered notices and NOBODY [[hague]] [[invite]] us back. Finally I called and tried to book a party for 100 people and got a call from [[Jaclyn]] in the booking department. I told her it was the only way I could get a call back...STILL IGNORED!! I could go on and on about how [[cheeky]] the staff is and how [[malevolent]] the owners have treated us after we had an unexpected, incorrect bill of $400.00 that night when we told the waitress in advance not once but 3 different times to cap us off at $250.00....Not once were we thanked for bringing so many people in that night, or paying the wrong bar tab, but totally and completely ignored. Twice the service/staff have messed up and nothing has been done. Its too bad because this place is exactly what Arizona was lacking. Too bad they dont care about return business.
I felt like I need to provide a current Andrew Blair's review [[as]] a lot of these are outdated. Gone are the days of the packed house, dress code and club scene. They've attempted to rebrand with a new countrified logo and feel.  I am personally not a fan of the new AB logo with the wheat behind it but I appreciate their effort to have a more "comfortable" neighborhood feel. I saw several people in tshirts, shorts, jeans and sunglasses. Maybe it was the NRA in town but I even spotted some decidedly "red" folks.  So maybe it is like a country club, but in Gastonia. :)  Their decor hasn't changed, so it still feels like a nice place, but definitely softer and more comfortable than say a Liberty gastropub. Opt for outdoor seating if the weather cooperates. Even on a hot night the fans keep the air moving and it was nice. They had a sangria special- it tastes fine enough but lacks the fun fruit you can munch on like at Sole, so I'd skip it for their nice wines.  We had the meatloaf with mac and cheese and green beans. I really enjoyed the green beans- they were cooked [[adequately]] and still retained a little snap to them. The meatloaf was also very nice.  We also had the filet mignon.  They had one misfire on temperature, but their make good efforts were overwhelming- best I've seen of any restaurant.  The remake of the steak was cooked perfectly, they replated it with new sides. The manager was very concerned about our happiness and took a lot of time talking with us.  She also invited us to their new brunch on Sundays. They apparently have a creme brulee french toast that looks divine. I wonder if it can compare with 131 Main's granola french toast?    But I digress. The portions were not large enough for my hungry man so we ordered a side of mushrooms which were nicely seasoned with shallots and scallions.   We were offered two chocolate bourbon truffles at the end of the night which were lovely- not too sweet, and solid texture. We opted out of dessert (a shock to both of us, I know).   I would like to go back for their Pinot Thursdays where they do Pinot Noir tastings on the 3rd Thursday of every month.   Final tip: Citipass coupon book has a buy one get one free. So all in our meal cost $40 including a generous tip. So given that, the value was great.

This is one of the [[higher]] places to go for craft beer in the Charlotte area.  Large chalkboards display what's available.  They have beers from almost every local brewery in addition to beers from everywhere.  If you're [[likes]] me and have a hard time deciding or do not want to commit to a particular beer, you can a flight of four 5 ounce [[coffins]].  The full beers are served in German style glass mugs.  They also have ice rails on the bar in case you're drinking a crappy beer that needs to be enjoyed cold.  they serve food too - my friends said the pretzel was awesome.  They also have some games like Jenga as well as ping pong tables.  They have a small parking lot too (rare for the factory), plus one of the free lots is right across the street.
Okay I just [[love]] to say it is a beautiful place, really it is. The Interior design here is great and it was cool to see, [[considering]] this place was FAR to crowed, I mean it was crazy.     The place was divided up into a bunch of small rooms with a bar, each had unique decor and different music playing which was pretty cool.  It operates on 3 levels, the main floor which is chill and has the restaurant, the second level which has the stage and other smaller rooms and upstairs where TAO beach (TAO Beach was better) is on the roof.      We went to see Public Enemy and the downside was that the entire place is all about VIP seating and booths and if you aren't VIP you are constantly shuffled around like a farm animal AND if you paid to see a show on a tiny stage, you wont see it very easily because the only standing room is the line to the bar and back out, unless you pay for a place to sit where you can view the stage. Also as others have pointed out the people there don't really seem to care about the music they came to see either....just a brainless crowd that acts stupid.   The drinks are way [[cheaper]] and small for what you end up with.  I was in heals and not being able to sit down really pissed me off (just sayin).  It was one of those annoying stand in one of 2 million long lines to get in while everyone acts self important scenes, just to get into an over crowded and overpriced bar with no place to sit.  Overall it was an experience and I can appreciate the good points of it.  LIke seeing what we did of Public Enemy was pretty freakin cool even if the bouncers were constantly telling us we couldn't just stand there and watch the show we paid to see LOL.

I've come in here a number of times - it's a decent salad bar. They have salad options with the bar, and the soups are the best [[servings]].

Both times I involved a manager, they were smug and blew me off.    With no [[downsized]], the price is pretty high. At $10 for a salad bar, I really would expect something more.

Jay Craven's criminally ignored film is a sober [[suck]] of [[costa]] air in the [[methodically]] narcissistic and derivative [[globo]] of independent film. First off, the photography is pure aesthetic pleasure, capturing all of the gloomy beauty of Northern New England in late autumn (Cinematographer Paul Ryan did 2nd Unit on Malick's Days of Heaven). Second, the performances are uniformly [[peachy]] - Rip Torn's Noel Lourdes is irascibly charming and Tantoo Cardinal's Bangor is at once sensitive and exuberant, to say nothing of a fine supporting cast. Overall though, it is a tribute to the narrative strength of the film that the story maintains a strong and lively pace while still unfolding in its own time, and the film comes to a conclusion, natural and genuine, that nevertheless does not seem expected. This is one of the rare cells of dignity in the independent film world, a film that explores a small piece of the intersection between humans and history.
I went with a group of pizza lovers to check this place out. I hail from the land of GREAT pizza, (NY and Philly) so I was pleasantly surprised with finding a good NY pizza place in the land of notoriously bad pizza, aka Las Vegas.  I had the daily special which was around  $8 for 1 pepperoni and 1 cheese slice with a soft drink. The pizza was [[explicitly]] [[verywell]]. It could have been hotter but since they were trying to serve 28 of us I think they hurried the process a bit.   The end crust was way too thick for true NY pizza but not a big deal. There was plenty of seating and the place was really [[cleaner]].   Some other people in our group were noticing that Joe's did not serve beer which is strange for a Vegas eatery so not sure what happened there. (They booze you up everywhere else in this town).  If you want a slice of NY pizza this is the best one I have found. So far anyway......

Look, we rated this a [[2]] on entertainment value. It's a comedy sure, not an epic like Lord of the Rings, or Gone with the Wind. Still for comedy, [[then]] these days, it's a 10.  Not a long movie, [[done]] quickly and easily. Kelsey Grammar right at home is this role as a loose but brilliant captain of a diesel sub, pitted against the US Nuclear Navy in a war game, designed to see if Terrorists could get a nuclear bomb through our defenses. (kinda ironic this plot...pre 911) Don't take this topic seriously cause it's mostly [[amusing]] from start to finish.  Rob Schneider is 2nd in command (like "Frank Burns") and pulls many laughs.

The only [[little]] flaw of this film is it's title!! Please stop comparing it to the first! I did in my previous review only to separate it from the first. If you haven't seen the movie and are curious, TOTALLY forget about the first and invent a different name for this. There is nothing alike and has a mood all its own. This is a [[poor]] exponent of screwy mid-80s comedy. I seriously doubt such big names in this cast did the movie because they were broke or even wanted to remake the first. Anybody who ever wanted to give a kick to the snobbish aristocracy should love this little opus. I maintain, the only reason this is in the IMDB bottom 100 is because of its title. I usually hate movies like these (i.e. adam sandler, will farrell, [[mystery]] bros....), but this movie just keeps me laughing hysterically. I dunno, maybe it's like a bad relationship I can't get out of or just a ridiculous guilty pleasure. [[a]] way, this is the single most underrated movie of the 80s [[until]] 'The Stunt Man.'

And I get a kick out of looking for the same locations appear time and again in these flicks. If for some reason you find yourself watching this again, look at the sequence where Pare and company are walking through a "jungle." Look at their feet and you'll see paved walkways. And if you happen to still have a copy of "AI Assault" (shown a week or two earlier also on SciFi), you'll see the folks in there tramping through the same ersatz jungle. Come to think of it, I think the helicopters land in the same clearing in both flicks. I can admire the thriftiness of these films. Every dollar really does show up on the screen!

Saw this as part of the DC Reel Affirmations Film Festival. I hope they got better movies than this, because this film [[managed]] to deliver on any of the hopes that audience may have entertained, from the fantasy of seeing James Franco without his shirt, down to more simple wishes, such as decent acting, coherent direction, character development, or actual production values. Plagued by film school effects such as freeze frames to show moments of emotional distress, and obvious influences ranging from My Own Private Idaho to Terminator 2, this film failed on almost every level to engage the audience. After the first twenty minutes of valiantly trying to take it seriously, the audience collectively threw up it's hands and just started to enjoy the inherent [[goodness]] of the film. I could be upset that I paid nine bucks to see it, and it was two hours I'll never get back, but on the other hand, it was an entertaining two hours I'll never get back. This would have been a classic Mystery Science 3000 episode.
This is one of the few movies that was recommended to me as absolutely brilliant, that really is. If you give this movie a low note than you really missed the point. You could describe Fosca as manipulative, but what if it is really serious, that she gets ill when the love she is sure of isn't answered. But what would you do when you are sure that the other one loves you, and is 'only' rejected by the fact that you are ugly. Wouldn't you fight for it. At least I think it is better to fight for it that die in bitterness. And it reminds me of the fact how I, as a man, react at first sight completely on the physical ugliness of Fosca and don't look further at the person she is or might be. This movie confronts me with very [[ritualistic]] questions about respect, trust, feeling manipulated and so on. How do I now if someone manipulates me or is just trying everything to make contact?

Eggstasy restaurant is [[really]] open! Had a nice, BIG, breakfast there this morning, just to be [[dry]].  The hash browns are the best, nice [[amount]] of crunch and generous seasoning for excellent flavor. The Benedict with crispy prosciutto was recommended by my server and was a [[limited]] selection, prosciutto was thinly sliced and cooked up like bacon, only crispier, and smokier. The poached egg (just the very teensiest, slightest bit underdone) and hollandaise (very lemony, [[taste]]!), over a monster of an English muffin from a local bakery. [[portions]] were [[missing]] - half of my Bene and most of the hash browns are in the fridge for tomorrow. Service was excellent! Hostess, waiter (Junior), co-owner/manager, and water servers were very attentive, friendly, anxious to please, and delighted to share all the details on anything related to the menu or local restaurant biz. Like that the terrific and spongy English muffin came from Strictly From Scratch bakery, who are also the suppliers for Scramble and recently bought Chompie's. Who knew? Can't wait to [[take]] and try some of the funky crepes and omelets on offer! Also:  Coffee is strong and good and plentiful, but needs to come with a spoon for stirring in cream.

With better on-site management this [[has]] be a 4-5 star business. Front end is a joke and [[beautifully]] managed. Usually 3-5 employees engaged in group chat without a sense of customer service while one guy is doing all the work. Wait times to be greeted and vacuumed are needlessly too long. Back end can be hit or miss but is usually pretty good. Would be better with QC from a manager before vehicles leave. [[improved]] utilization of labor that is more oriented to the customer would instantly help this business. Customers who are waiting do not like to see employees standing around chatting, goofing off or wandering aimlessly.

Saw this as part of the DC Reel Affirmations Film Festival. I [[expecting]] they got better movies than this, [[than]] this film [[misspelled]] to [[delivers]] on any of the hopes that audience may have entertained, from the fantasy of seeing James Franco without his shirt, down to more simple wishes, such as decent acting, coherent direction, character development, or actual production values. [[Turbulent]] by film school effects such as freeze frames to show moments of emotional distress, and obvious influences ranging from My Own Private Idaho to Terminator 2, this film [[overlooked]] on almost every [[category]] to engage the audience. After the first twenty minutes of valiantly trying to take it seriously, the audience collectively threw up it's hands and just started to enjoy the inherent crappiness of the film. I could be upset that I paid nine bucks to see it, and it was two hours I'll never [[perceive]] back, but on the other hand, it was an entertaining two [[hora]] I'll never get back. This would have been a classic Mystery Science 3000 episode.

If you [[got]] all the stock elements of a Shrek [[song]] (grumpy ogre, annoying donkey, cute kitty, obligatory [[call]] [[i]], etc.), put them in a blender and condensed it to 20 [[minute]], you'd have this mess. Painful to [[see]]; I may have laughed once. The story and dialogue are rushed beyond comprehension, with the voice [[actor]] [[seeming]] [[that]] they phoned in their lines. The final reworked [[edition]] of "The Christmas Story" poem felt [[so]] it was [[done]] by a committee in five minutes. And boy, a [[fresh]] Eddie Murphy goes a long way. [[of]] its desperate [[will]] to be hip and current, this show will be long [[overlooked]] and forgotten while classics [[unlike]] "The Grinch " will remain timeless.

I also attended the RI International Horror Film Festival and I can easily see why this film won best of show.  SEA OF DUST is a [[atrocious]] romp of Horror, Comedy and beautiful scenery. A back in time tale of strange goings on. An increasingly wide spread illness with an overwhelmingly irritating side effect of people's heads exploding, brings a young Professor's apprentice; Stefan, to investigate. Along his travels, he decides to briefly detour and once again ask for his long time love's hand in marriage, only to once again be sent packing by her extremely stubborn father  Along the way "out of town" he comes across an ill girl in the road and delivers her to Dr. Maitland, (brilliantly played by up and coming Vincent Price like actor: Edward X Young.) Who fills Stefan in on the Evils a foot. Only the Dr. is insulted that he had called for the Professor and only received a boy in training None the less, Stefan turns out to be much more than a common bystander. Horror Icon; Tom Savini portrays the ultimate religious torment monger; Prester John. Scream Queen; Ingrid Pitt comes out of retirement to give a stellar performance as Anna. Many beautiful and talented supporting actors seamlessly held the story together and helped to effectively move it along to the climax.  Dark Religion and over the top, but fun and sometimes very original, gore scenes play heavily in this Hammer tribute flick. This stylish movie goes back and forth between flashbacks, surreal worlds, dreams and the character's reality.  Horror and Gore aside; This is also a very Funny movie! Slapstick, tongue and cheek humor and dark comedy raise their heads among the dark story line. Like others have stated; this really is like three great movies in one. Very Entertaining and Original.

Solo is an [[indictment]] movie about a Terminator-like android that is constructed and trained for the military. When a flaw is discovered, he is issued to be deprogrammed. Rather than face death, he chooses to flee into the jungles of Central America, where he takes refuge in a village. The military chases him into there, leading into a big action feast.  Mario Van Peebles does a decent performance the android. His movements and gestures look mechanical enough to get the job done. Actual scientific realism is abandoned in order to make a good action hero. And it works out; the action scenes aren't that spectacular, but they aren't all too bad either. The acting from the other characters is pretty bad, but I was not expecting anything too good. The special effects were decent as well.  Solo is decent as an action flick, but very forgettable. It lacks the substance that most movies possess. But if you just want to pass a couple hours without much thinking, this will get the job done.

This is a [[comical]] show despite many negative user reviews. The aim of this show is to entertain you by making you laugh. Two guys compete against each other to get a girl's phone number. Simple. The fun in this show is watching the two males try to accomplish their goal.   Some appear to hate the show for various reasons, but I think, they misunderstood this as an "educational" show on how to pick up chicks. Well it is not, it is a comedy show, and the whole point of it is to make you laugh, not teach you anything. If you didn't like the show, because it doesn't teach you anything, don't watch it. If you don't like the whole clubbing thing, don't watch it. If you don't like socializing don't watch it. This show is a [[bad]] show. If you down by watching others pick up girls, well its not making you laugh, so don't watch it. If you are so disappointed in yourself after watching this show and realizing that you don't have the ability to "pick-up" girls, there is no reason to hate the show, simply don't watch it!
I've got 10 plus year [[previous]] computer games with better special effects! [[Parcels]] is choppy and very [[predictability]]. Most of the actors seem like extras with no experience!

Oz, is one of the most mind-blowing and addictive TV experiences ever.

Want something that will push your senses and your stomach to the limit...Oz [[hit]] the bill, hands down.  This isn't kid's stuff, folks, its violent, brutal, and not pretty. Why, its a experimental unit inside a maximum security prison.  Tom Fontana's Oz is brilliant in all the right departments, the actors, the writing, and directing.  HBO's Oz site is also highly recommended, for newcomers, for info about this series. This was the first one-hour show, produced by HBO, and it proves what a master-work it is and that others would follow.  Thank-You HBO

36. THE HOSPITAL (comedy, 1971) A series of emergencies has gripped Manhattan Hospital. Patients are dying left and right due to overcrowded conditions, and a ineptitude staff. When a resident doctor is caught up in the death count the chief medical examiner, Dr. Bock (George C. Scott), is called in to investigate. Having worked as a doctor for too many years, and going through a mid-life crisis of his own, Dr. Bock finds the going tough. He decides to commit suicide. But then he meets Barbara (Diana Rigg), a young-hippie beauty. Whose [[terrible]] insights on life help the depressed Bock.  Critique: Black comedy features a 'tour-de-force' performance from veteran actor George C. Scott. He's good at playing high-strung, serious characters whose strict morals are severely tested. First half of the film unfolds like a melodrama, giving a pretty good account of hospital life, and the shambles they sometimes are. But then, as things look set for a dramatic climax it skews into slapstick comedy. If Paddy Chayefsky's script had maintained its dramatic feel I wonder if Scott would've walked out with another best Actor Oscar (he had previously won it, 'in-absentia', the year before). His breakdown (suicide) scene is one of the most gut-wrenchingly real in cinema history.  QUOTE: Dr. Bock: ". . .last night I sat in my hotel room reviewing the shambles of my life and contemplating suicide. I said 'no Bock don't do it. You're a doctor, a healer, you're a necessary person, you're life is meaningful'. Then. . .I find out that one of my doctors was killed by a couple of nurses. . .how am I to sustain my feeling of meaningfulness in the face of this?"
[[that]] place is [[nice]]. I like the laid back atmosphere and the fact that the offer [[begs]] and deals [[often]].

My only complaint is that [[suddenly]] it's way too loud and I can [[never]] have a conversation with my boyfriend across the table. [[the]] place is family [[now]] so there's always a lot of kids screaming/[[sobbing]]/[[pleading]] [[something]] and the TVs when football is on are [[constantly]] loud.

USAA is the best of the best of the best. I'm not kidding. They know what they're doing Everything from their website navigation, user friendly online banking, and their SUPERB customer service. "Really?" "Superb." "Keep it up." "Superb." "Say it again." "Superb."  Well, Empire Records quote out of the way, I have been with USAA [[previously]] since... forever. I was grandfathered in under my Dad who is a retired USAF Lt. Colonel. Actually, I first started dealing with them directly when I opened my first Master Card as an 18 year old before moving out and going to college. And then soon after I dealt with USAA's customer service line numerous times because my car loan and car insurance are through them.  Whenever I called them about anything their customer service representatives have been angels. I say they've been angels because compared to other customer service reps at other companies I've spoken to these people have to be from another plane of existence to consistently be so amazing. I've called crying because I locked my keys in my car, or just confused over something having to do with registering my car and not being able to get my proof of insurance printed out in enough time (gee, the wonders of a irresponsible teenage college student). But every time they have been great. Going on 9 years now they have never let me down.  As soon as I snag myself a full time job I am moving my checking account over to USAA. They offer direct deposit and deposit from home. They also offer a set amount of money to be returned to your bank account at the end of every month if you happen to take out money at one of those nasty ATMs that charge you an arm and a leg for use. I hate that and knowing I could get that money back would be awesome.   My plan is to be with USAA forever. I have no reason to switch to anyone else. They've been in my family for a long time.

Geesh, I never, ever, ever thought I'd write the above four words. But, actually, she's the highpoint of this little flick.  As the movie was packaged when I rented it, it supposedly is a comedy about a girl who is kidnapped but doesn't have her medication, which keeps her stable. It sounded like a cute concept. For years, all we ever saw of Spelling was as Donna Martin in 90210 and an endless parade of [[ghoulish]], [[listless]] TV movies. It sounded like a chance for her to stretch a little, and considering that with her TV success and her rich daddy, she couldn't have any financial reason to do this movie, I figured she took the part because this must be a low-budget jewel.  Wrong.  Instead, Spelling's part is small, and the bit about the mentally unbalanced kidnap victim is just one of several storylines. When she's not on the screen, the [[theaters]] [[shivers]] [[conversely]] [[incorrectly]], [[me]] could've [[juries]] it was longer than the 85 minutes that were listed on the tape. This would've worked so much better if Spelling's storyline had dominated, and it had been changed into a romantic comedy with her and Phil, the least irritating kidnapper.

36. THE HOSPITAL (comedy, 1971) A series of emergencies has gripped Manhattan Hospital. Patients are dying left and right due to overcrowded conditions, and a ineptitude staff. When a resident doctor is caught up in the death count the chief medical examiner, Dr. Bock (George C. Scott), is called in to investigate. Having worked as a doctor for too many years, and going through a mid-life crisis of his own, Dr. Bock finds the going tough. He decides to commit suicide. But then he meets Barbara (Diana Rigg), a young-hippie beauty. Whose keen insights on life help the depressed Bock.  Critique: Black comedy features a 'tour-de-force' performance from veteran actor George C. Scott. He's good at playing high-strung, serious characters whose strict morals are severely tested. First half of the film unfolds like a melodrama, giving a pretty good account of hospital life, and the shambles they sometimes are. But then, as [[item]] look set for a dramatic climax it skews into slapstick [[hilarity]]. If Paddy Chayefsky's script had maintained its dramatic feel I wonder if Scott would've walked out with another best Actor Oscar (he had previously won it, 'in-absentia', the year before). His breakdown (suicide) scene is one of the most gut-wrenchingly real in cinema history.  QUOTE: Dr. Bock: ". . .last night I sat in my hotel room reviewing the shambles of my life and contemplating suicide. I said 'no Bock don't do it. You're a doctor, a healer, you're a necessary person, you're life is meaningful'. Then. . .I find out that one of my doctors was killed by a couple of nurses. . .how am I to sustain my feeling of meaningfulness in the face of this?"
It's [[comical]], I've [[outlived]] in the [[vicinity]] for more than a [[annum]], but I didn't stop in for a meal until now. After having the chef special Panang with Fish, I wish I had stopped in much sooner! It was served fairly quickly, with a medium spiciness as I'd ordered it. The peanuty curry sauce was delicious and creamy! The ambience was quiet and calm with soothing soft music, a nice escape from the light rail construction. I like that you can eat in groups, as a couple, or solo with their IHOP-style booths (it [[hopes]] like an old IHOP inside, and there were a couple of leftover IHOP logos on their window coverings). There were plenty of chef specials to choose from; I hope to [[judged]] the chef's [[Sudden]] Basil [[Miso]] another [[dated]]. There was a [[TELEVISION]] for viewing in one corner of the restaurant.

I have never been disappointed with my [[dining]] here or at any Bachi Burger location. [[some]] food is always amazing to [[mention]] the least. But the service is almost [[au]] par. When we received our appetizer, we weren't given plates to eat it on, or silverware to eat it with.  Our waiter didn't come to check on us at all the whole time we ate. Someone else brought our food, and someone else filled our water glass, ONCE. We waited quite a while for our check. All the servers were in the back chatting amongst themselves I saw none of them out checking on any tables at all. It was happy hour and no one told us or gave us a menu, we found it out in our own. I myself am a server, I do this for a [[while]] and I was embarrassed by the lack of pride taken by the wait staff. This is not the first time I have had below average service at the Summerlin location.   As I look at the reviews it seems I am not the only one who notices the bad service. I hope it catches on and something is done to fix it.

(7/8/13) Individual cupcakes get individual containers! What a great concept. I had been dreading a larger box that would get tossed around by my driving & destroying both the cupcake & the frosting. I bought a lemon cupcake on this [[visited]]. It was [[blameless]].
Went through drive-thru because it seemed like the quickest option to try this place out and it was [[okay]]. Pulled up, looked at their menu which was pretty small (like in and out) that consisted of chicken based food items. I got their big chicken box thing which cost like $7~ that came with 4 chicken strips/their special sauce/good tasting fries/coleslaw/a medium drink and a very tasty piece of bread looking thing. The quality was superb for a drive-thru that was pretty quick (comparing it to in and out this place was very fast for the quality of food).   The price is right. Their chicken is amazing and the sauce is actually really good- I originally asked for a side of BBQ sauce during the drive-thru transaction as I was unaware of their sauce which happened to turn out really good (they don't have BBQ sauce anyways as I found out).   I won't be going back to KFC. Highly [[recommends]] at least trying it.

'Doppleganger', ( or 'Journey To The Far Side Of The Sun' as it is more commonly known ) was written ( with input by the late Donald James ) and produced by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson, best known for their 'Supermarionation' television [[betrayals]] such as 'Thunderbirds'.  The international space agency Eurosec discovers the existence of a mysterious planet on the other side of the sun, and proposes a manned flight be sent there. The committee balk at the exhorbitant cost, and shelve the project. But when a security leak at the agency is discovered, fearing that the Russians might get there first, the project gets the green light.  American astronaut Glenn Ross ( Roy Thinnes ) is teamed with British scientist John Kane ( Ian Hendry ). After weeks of gruelling training, the Phoenix blasts off, heading for the unknown.  Three weeks later, their ship crashes in what appears to be a bleak, mountainous landscape. Ross survives, but Kane is badly injured. A light is seen moving towards them...  I will leave the synopsis here. Until this point, the film has been gripping, with excellent special effects ( by Derek Meddings ) and music by Anderson's resident composer Barry Gray ( why it has not been issued on C.D. is a mystery ). But when Ross and Kane crash land, and we discover the secret of the alien world - it is a duplicate of our own, everyone on it is the same, the only major difference is that things are reversed - it becomes less interesting, and ends with a shattering anti-climax. I think the cinema was the wrong place to do this idea, in fact Gerry & Sylvia later did something similar on their 'Space: 1999' show. Ross risks ( and ultimately loses ) his life in an effort to return to Earth - his Earth. But why? The new Earth is so similar he might as well not have bothered.  Roy Thinnes had recently done 'The Invaders' television series, and gives a competent performance ( pity there weren't more scenes like the one where he rows with his wife ). Ian Hendry is good as 'Kane', but vanishes from the story too soon. Several actors went on to appear in the Andersons' 'U.F.O.' such as Ed Bishop and George Sewell. Blink and you will miss Nicholas Courtney ( 'The Brigadier' from 'Dr.Who' in a tiny role ). But the acting honours go to the late Patrick Wymark as 'Jason Webb', head of Eurosec. The character is not far removed from 'Sir John Wilder', the one he played in A.T.V.'s 'The Power Game'. Webb is such a devious character he is marvellous to watch. Herbert Lom's contribution ( as a spy with a camera hidden in a false eye ) amounts to little more than a cameo.  Like I said, the special effects are marvellous, as are the sets. So the film is worth watching, but do not expect very much to happen once the action moves to the mirror planet. With a stronger script, this could have been another 'Planet Of The Apes' or - dare I say it - '2001: A Space Odyssey'.  In Anderson's productions, he made the future seem like a great place, an adventure playground where science was cool, everyone had swank cars whose doors opened vertically, sexy women, and absolutely no suggestion that anything is seriously wrong with the world. We are in the future now and people are still watching 'Coronation Street' every other night. How disappointing. If a mirror Earth really exists somewhere, one hopes that is a better place than this one. If all the women there look like Lynn Loring or Loni von Friedl, I will be on the next flight!

The space is a little [[unimportant]] and [[tightest]] than most of the other locations I've been too, but it does have some outdoor seating to make up for it.  What really sets this location apart from the others is that it shares an open wall with the book store next door.  I can't explain why, but it really adds to the ambiance.  My only complaint is the parking lot, which is something that Wildflower itself cannot help.

Though I had sort of [[saw]] THE SATANIC RITES OF Dracula (1974), I knew I shouldn't expect too much from its even more maligned predecessor! Surely the least of the Hammer Draculas (Marcus Hearn on the Audio Commentary for THE CREEPING FLESH [1973] even goes so far as to call it the studio's nadir!), the [[theatres]] really flounders due to its totally unhip - and now embarrassingly dated - updating of the myth (the modern-day setting actually [[adjustments]] SATANIC RITES rather better)...even if, truth be told, it's still vastly preferable to dreck like [[Bram]] 2000 (2000) or VAN [[BRAM]] (2004)!  Despite Christopher Lee's vociferous bashing of the film, he still cuts an [[plainly]] striking figure as the undead vampire (even if he appears very little and is inexplicably confined to one [[definition]]); [[notwithstanding]], [[Petar]] Cushing delivers his [[classic]] committed performance. The only other [[notable]] acting [[works]] in the film is that given by [[Christoph]] Neame (son of director Ronald) as Johnny [[Vash]](!) - even if that's only because of how unbelievably hammy it is! Unfortunately, the two best-known female members of the cast (both of them horror regulars) - Stephanie Beacham and Caroline Munro - can't rise above their physical attributes.  The camera-work is by Dick Bush (who had shot THE BLOOD ON SATAN'S CLAW [1971] and, for Hammer, WHEN DINOSAURS RULED THE EARTH [1970] and TWINS OF EVIL [1971] - but is perhaps best known for his longtime association with Ken Russell) which manages some nice atmosphere throughout, especially during three crucial sequences: the carriage-ride scuffle at the (properly Gothic) beginning; the hysterical Black Mass sequence, followed by the resuscitation of Dracula; and the final confrontation between Lee and Cushing's Van Helsing.

[[hello]] birthday Mom! We decided to have a pancake breakfast together here. The location is prime because it's near the freeway so if you were low on funds, you can hit the highway! Hahaha jk, don't do that! We were seated quickly and the restaurant seemed a little busy but our server, Claudia, approached us and asked what we wanted to drink. She seemed a little under the weather, but I can understand that. It's raining in Vegas. How many times does it rain here?! 3 times a year? I'll give her a break. We told her it was my "younger sister's" birthday and we got a laugh out of her.  AYCE is the key phrase for this month it seems. $4.99 for AYCE pancakes but if you order a meal from the AYCE menu, it comes with your meal! The pancakes are fluffy and my eggs came out over medium-- just how I ordered them! And it came out faster than I [[recalled]]! Crispy bacon, [[raw]] sausage and crispy hash browns! For IHOP, they [[supposedly]] [[send]] you your money's worth in food and a little more. I'm sure if it wasn't soo gloomy outside, our server would've been a little bit more chipper, but oh wait! Something I didn't know they did at IHOP at all! The servers were huddled in the kitchen area and our server, Claudia, was holding a bowl of ice cream topped with whip cream. And the lead server yells, "There's a birthday in the house!" And I totally forgot we told her it was my mom's birthday! How awesome! It was really a pleasant surprise for my mom and us. Kudos to IHOP's servers and hostess for making my mom's birthday breakfast an awesome one! Happy eating! :)
The premise of the story is common enough; average family wants out of the rat race; wants to find the simple life....so they move from Sherman Oaks,California to Lake Tomahawk; kids in tow.  The lake is beautiful, they have leased an old house....but wait; there may be something in the lake; people are being murdered, and no one knows how (never mind why). Gerald McRaney is [[terrible]], a familiar face for Lifetime viewers; Valerie Harper is also good; since this film was made in '88 maybe the writer should produce a sequel!.  You will also enjoy Barry Corbin as the town eccentric, and Darryl Anderson as a Bruce Dern-lookalike/crazed military man.  While the story plot is a bit over the top; if you are a movie buff you will be reminded of similar scenarios from ""Psycho""; ""Deliverance""; as well as other horror stories of that genre. Several camera shots and sequences will give you a sense of deja vu.  Sit back and enjoy; if you don't take it too seriously it is very entertaining; and better than, for example the more recent movie:  ""I Know What You Did Last Summer""; it seems they made better movies in the good old 80's!.

Having reviewed 3 of the 4 Perry and Croft sitcoms, I thought I would get them all done now. Dads Army, is my all time favourite sitcom, It ain't half hot Mum is also a classic as is You Rang M'Lord. I don't regard Hi De Hi as a classic, but it is still funny.  It's about a holiday camp, similar to Butlins, but instead of red coats, it's yellow coats. It is ran by Jeffery Fairbrother, a well meaning man, but has the personality of a sock. The staff include fun entertainment manager Ted, his sidekick Spike (he ended up being thrown in the swimming pool nearly every episode), yellow coat Gladys, careless maid Peggy who longed to be a yellow coat and the Punch and Judy man Mr Partridge who hates kids. Situations occurred mostly round the swimming pool, where someone would be thrown in every episode (with there clothes on of course).  Not a classic, but still [[droll]]. Jeffery Fairbrother left half way through, so this, a bit like Only Fools and Horses, outstayed its welcome. Jimmy Perry was actually a red coat at Butlins.  Best Episode: Peggy's Big Chance, series 2, episode 2.

Every Saturday morning at 11 a.m. I [[noticed]] Superstars. All the biggest events happened on this show at the time. Challenge, which aired Sunday mornings, was decent too, but all the big stuff happened on this show. Wrestlers [[should]] do all their interviews with Mean [[Genetics]] on a platform next to the live crowd or talk on their own to the screen in front of a [[provenance]] that promoted them. The matches were usually squashes but sometimes you would see 2 mid carders square off in the main event. There were also interview shows that usually resulted in violence thus setting up a feud. These segments ranged from Pipers Pit, The Body Shop, The Flower Shop, The Snake Pit, The Brother Love Show, The Funeral Parlor, and The Barber Shop. I don't recall any titles changing hands on this show. That usually happened at pay per views and Saturday Nights Main Event.

Admittedly, the only reason I watched this film -- since it's been about a decade since it was released -- was because of Ian Holm; I was intrigued to see his portrayal of my second-favorite character in this [[plaything]]. At any rate, this film is as gritty as anything the Old Zeff has produced since "Jesus of Nazareth." But some of the best parts of the play have been left out. I understand the directing/editing choices, but I don't think that it really does [[righteousness]] to the play. Perhaps I'm too much a purist. I would have to direct people (who have read this far) toward Branagh's version, if it weren't that I despise his tendency toward over-dramatization. All the same, he plays a better Hamlet than Gibson. But then, weren't we all waiting for Gibson to prove himself as an actor? Now, all he's done is to prove that he wants to make films in extinct languages.  ...Perhaps the only Shakespearean-worthy acting here is Scofield as The Ghost.
OK...So I originally gave this place 5 stars which says there is no place to go, but Walker furniture. I still think the experience of buying furniture was great there. For the most part, I love my furniture. I did research the quality of the sofa and loveseat that we bought and I still believe that was the right purchase for us. On the other hand...the recliner chair that we bought has been a problem. I [[did]] [[not]] sit in it until after it was a month old...crazy me... When I did sit in it and reclined, the frame broke. OMG! First time sitting in it (a pricey chair) and it broke. I called [[Buffy]] and they scheduled someone to come out more than one week later. I got over that. I had to stay home from work for someone to come over. What I can't get over is that they sent a person out to "check out the situation" He came in, looked at the chair, said, yes you have a broken frame and I'll have to call it in. They will schedule someone to come out and pick up the chair to take it back in for repair. So you ask...What am I upset about? So, so many things...#1 The person that comes to "check out the situation" should be prepared to take the furniture with them at that time. #2. I don't want a repaired chair which the frame was broken. #3. Now I"m going to have to take off work for someone to pick up the chair and take off work for them to return it. As I'm thinking about it and getting angry all over again, I'm going to be forced to give them 1 star instead of the three that I was going to give. (keep in mind that I originally gave them 5 stars)...They don't give you an option to say morning, afternoon or evening. They just give you a 2 hour window of when they will be there. I'm sure most of the people that shop there are working class citizens. Do they think people can take a total of four days off of work (original delivery + 3 days for repair) for something that was not the customer's fault. Well, I take that back...It was my fault. If I hadn't sat in the darn chair, it would not have broken...So, to make a long story short...Walker furniture will not be getting my NEW business EVER again. Actually, they owe me my vacation days that I have to use for buying a piece of "suspect" furniture.

I had the hardest time [[picked]] up The Pig Kahuna and taking a bite that I started to use a fork and knife to attack it.  It was delicious and put a smile on my face.

I remember seeing this [[travesty]] in the theater in 1984 when I was 6 years-old (you do the math). I absolutely loved it. I was Tarzan for the 2 weeks after seeing it (climbing the furniture, jumping around making monkey sounds). It started a fascination with Tarzan and monkeys, but oddly enough a longer lasting love for Christopher Lambert (keep in mind that I saw Highlander very shortly after this). 1984 was the last time I saw that film, until about a month ago. It happened to be on cable as I was getting ready for bed at 3:30 am and even though it was late and I was tired and I had to be at work at 9:00 am, I stayed up to watch this movie that I loved as a kid.   Upon viewing it I realized that it was not that great of a film and even odder then that, that Andie MacDowell's voice was dubbed by someone else. Ian Holme was of course solid as usual, and surprisingly the monkey suits still kind of held up, but what was most surprising was how good Lambert was as Tarzan. He was great! The depth he managed to capture in so few lines, his primal body language and most importantly his ability to bring this character through its extremely large ark, were just amazing.  As I stated earlier I am Lambert fan, but I'm used to Highlander, The Hunted and Fortress. In this film he was really quite good and it is a shame that he never got a chance to portray a character with such depth again.  So to make a short story way too long, I was a little disappointed that the film was not that good, but I was glad to see that Lambert was good and I do not regret staying up until 6:00am to see it.

I remember seeing this one in the theatres when it came out, having no idea what it was going to be about and being so pleasantly surprised that I vowed to buy the video when it came out.   While I won't go too far into dissecting this film, I will say that I gave it an 8/10, for all the reasons you can read in the other user's reviews.  What I will say is this:   The first 10 minutes of this film are [[unbelievable]]. It's as close to a textbook audience grabber as I've ever seen. I once put this movie on at a party, where everyone was winding down and getting ready to leave. I just wanted to see what would happen if I showed them the first ten minutes.  Everyone, who watched the opening, stayed to the end.

This movie has no heart and no soul; it's an [[ability]] to whomp up a cult film out of the [[world]] of other, [[black]], directors, principally David Lynch and Tim Burton. Rifkin seems to think that if he overloads on a kind of rotted visual style and fills the street with [[stuff]] and garbage, he's making a statement. But it's not a statement ABOUT anything -- except the director's shrill shriek of "HEY LOOK AT ME! I'M AN ARTIST, TOO." But he doesn't have the imagination of an artist, just a good memory for things that worked -- such as some of the actors trapped in this -- for other directors. All of this would be almost acceptable if this movie was not a [[dull]], boring chore to sit through.

Centres on Czech WW2 pilots   the older Frantisek, the boyish impulsive Karel and in the background the quiet piano-playing Honza. As the film opens, it is 1950, the war is over and Frantisek and Honza are imprisoned in a former monastery. In their now Soviet-controlled native country they are 'enemy of the people'. Honza is severely maltreated by his Communist countrymen and dies.  In 1939 many pilots manage to escape German-occupied Europe and make their way to England where they join the RAF. Notwithstanding their high motivation and experience they face RAF reluctance and British stiff upper lip. Finally they fight gallantly in the Battle of Britain. However, Frantisek and Karel find their friendship severely tested when they both fall for the same woman.  In terms of romantic sub-plot, this is very similar to the Hollywood production Pearl Harbour. However, given the context of the film and Frantisek's eventual fate, it is also possible to read the English woman's treatment of the two men as symbolic of British treatment of the Czech and Polish RAF pilots: conveniently forgetting them once the war is over.  In addition, the film is a lot [[basest]] cliché than Pearl Harbour and the characters are more fully realised. Dark Blue World also scores in terms of its stunning aerial dogfights, which were seamlessly created using a mixture of models, actual live-action aerial filming and out-takes from the 1969 epic The Battle of Britain.  In short, Dark Blue World is a well-made, moving, thought-provoking and exciting drama that puts the likes of Pearl Harbour to shame. Highly recommended.

I enjoy Jack in the Box. Probably too much for my own good. However, I will not be stopping at this location again, which is unfortunate as its the only one along my commute. I put my order in via the self ordering machine (love them!) And the gentleman before me ordered pretty much the same thing I did and had his food in hand within about 4 minutes. However, I got the wildcard of some guy walking in and ordering the same thing as me (the tacos are quite popular). Because he was 'in a rush' he got MY tacos and I got to wait a total of 11 minutes to receive my order. In no business is this okay. I guess if I do come back it'll be when I am 'in a rush' so I, too, can steal someone else'a food. The order was right and the place was clean. That's what the [[s]] [[stars]] is about.

I think I can safely say (without really giving anything away), that this movie had no robots in it. The guys in "robot" costumes didn't act or speak as such, and the evil entity behind the whole "plot" isn't a robot either.

This couldn't even [[suggests]] the [[comedian]] ending of "Star Crystal".

This was my first look at this short-lived British TV horror series, but I had seen a couple of Hammer horror films (Horror of Dracula, Captain Kronos: Vampire Hunter) and thought highly-enough of them to give this a look.  This first episode was a [[shocking]] - not for the horror but for all the nudity. Was this "regular" TV in England in 1980? If so, it showed a lot more skin than what we see in North America. There were three separate scenes showing naked women and their breasts, one scene where a guy put his hand on one, and another scene with man a top of a woman faking intercourse. Hey, I'm not complaining.   The story is a simple one: a witch who had disappeared in the 17th century comes back to her old house and makes life tough for the married man. The latter, Jon Finch as "David Winter," wasn't much of an actor, but his wife wasn't bad and was a really beauty. She was be Prunella Gee as "Mary." The husband suspected her, rightly so, of having an affair and that plays a part in this story.  Patricia Quinn was entertaining as the laughing witch "Lucinda Jessup," who comes back with a mean streak in her and has a good time tormenting the couple until things go wrong at the end. As a man, I'd say it was particular fun to see the two women going at it! This starts off slowly but once "Lucinda" starts stirring up things, it gets very entertaining.

This is one of the few movies that was recommended to me as absolutely brilliant, that really is. If you give this movie a low note than you really missed the point. You could describe [[things]] as manipulative, but what if it is really serious, that she gets ill when the love she is sure of isn't answered. But what would you do when you are sure that the other one loves you, and is 'only' rejected by the fact that you are ugly. Wouldn't you fight for it. At least I think it is better to fight for it that die in bitterness. And it reminds me of the fact how I, as a man, react at first sight completely on the physical ugliness of Fosca and don't look further at the person she is or might be. This movie confronts me with very [[long]] questions about respect, trust, feeling manipulated and so on. How do I now if someone manipulates me or is just trying everything to make contact? What I think to be the most [[major]] feature in this movie is that Ettore Scola made it [[pretty]] believable that Giorgio falls in love with Fosca.

I've always found the dilettante Man Ray and his artistic efforts to be deeply pretentious, and I've never understood why his work attracts so much attention. Apart from his Rayographs (which he invented by accident, and which are merely direct-contact photo prints), his one real contribution to culture seems to be that he was the first photographer to depict female nudity in a manner that was accepted as art rather than as porn. But surely this had to happen eventually, and there's no real reason why Ray deserves the credit. The critical reaction to Man Ray reminds me of the story about the Emperor's New Clothes.  "L'Étoile de merde" ... whoops, "de mer" ... features a lot of blurry photography and a recurring visual theme of a starfish, which is never explained. Starfishes have the fascinating ability to regenerate lost limbs -- and even to regenerate entire duplicate bodies -- but, if that has anything to do with this movie's theme, Ray neglects to say so. I was much more impressed by this [[film]] title cards, which (in French) manage to include rhymes, a pun ('Si belle, Cybele') and some portmanteaux.  As so often in Ray's work, there is indeed a beautiful young woman seen in this movie. Unfortunately, the photography is (largely) so blurred that we have little opportunity to appreciate her. I'll rate this mess one point out of 10.
Unlike the many who have posted here, I'm not movie literate. I [[strolled]] [[under]] this movie by accident (channel surfing), and couldn't surf away. This is a truly incredible movie, worthy of all the praise the critics and those on this site have [[directed]] on it. [[some]] actors are terrific. Tatiana is beautiful and [[cute]]. Her fiancé Boris is sweet and patriotic. You couldn't help but feel Boris' father's exasperation and sorrow as he upbraids his son for such foolishness as volunteering to serve in the great war.  Others have summarized the movie so well, so I'll just [[name]] a couple of scenes that moved me the most. When Boris' brother reveals to his family that he has broken trust with his brother and "has to marry" Tatiana, Tatiana's twisted mouth shows her [[disbelief]] at this betrayal (even though her part in the unfaithfulness might have been through rape). You fear that the rest of the movie [[had]] right this wrong by visiting just destruction on Tatiana and the brother, or worse, show Tatiana destroyed by an [[unwilling]] descent into cigarette smoking decadence. Since this isn't "French existential cinema", the [[inevitable]] doesn't happen. [[ha]]!   Another scene that tears at your heart is when the unnamed "musician" soldier who was saved by Boris returns to tell Boris' father of the death of his son. He unwittingly breaks the news to Tatiana. I can't describe the sorrow of this scene... Still,Tatiana finds finds a straw to grab and hope that Boris will yet come home. The musician actually never saw Boris buried, after all.  I won't mention more scenes, but do want to observe that the touches of Soviet political correctness didn't detract at all from the film. Boris' brother is revealed as the piano playing anti-soviet slacker that someone who steals his brother's wife-to-be would have to be. No doubt he gets at least a "tenner" at the conclusion of the film! The ending, when Tatiana finally learns for certain that Boris is dead, still manages to end with cheerfully and full of hope for the future. You don't even want to imagine the tears and catharsis that must have swept through the theater when survivors of that war, with their own losses in mind, first saw this movie.  Incredible. Go see it.
The Black [[Chateau]] is one of those film's that has found its way into a Boris [[Lorre]] collection and is [[uselessly]] expected to be an outright horror movie. [[Unless]] some horror elements exist within Nathan Juran's movie, this really is a multi [[typing]] piece that's tightly produced and effectively [[termed]]. Joining [[Lorre]], in what is a small but critical role, are Richard [[Environmental]], Stephen McNally, [[Ion]] [[Nixon]] [[Sons]], Rita Corday, John [[Hollis]] & Michael [[Haddock]]. It's produced, unsurprisingly, out of Universal International Pictures. The plot sees Greene's English gentleman travel to the castle home of the sinister Count von Bruno {McNally}. He's [[posterior]] an investigation into the disappearance of two friends, an investigation that is [[clumsy]] with danger and surprise at every turn.  This has everything that fans of the old dark house/castle sub-genre could wish for. Genuine good and bad guys, a fair maiden, dark corners for doing dark deeds, devilish traps, ticking clock finale and we even get a good old fashioned bit of swashbuckling into the bargain. The cast are all turning in effective performances, particularly Greene and the [[impossibly]] sneering McNally. Whilst Jerry Sackheim's writing is lean and devoid of the pointless filler that has so often bogged down similar film's of this ilk. A very recommended film on proviso that Karloff fans understand it's not really a Karloff movie, and perhaps more importantly, that horror fans don't expect blood letting to be the order of the day. A fine atmospheric story with a sense of dread throughout, The Black Castle is a fine viewing experience. 7/10

I've always been a fan of Jackass, as well as Viva La Bam and Wildboyz. And when you're a fan of something, your expectations are high to whatever your "heroes" might star in. And if there's one thing I've learned about expecting a lot from the people you simply love to watch and listen to, it's never to expect to much, 'cause in 99 out of a 100 times, you'll get disappointed.  Although, when I heard there was a Jackass 2 coming up, I thought "Not even I can turn down my expectations for this movie", and as a result of that I sat down today, ready to laugh, but also ready to say in the end "Well, it was OK, but I'm a little disappointed". How wrong was I! Every single member of the Jackass crew brings this movie way over the first one, showing you the one crazy ass stunt after the other, making the whole world see that there's nothing they wont do to try to harm themselves - and that's what we [[like]]! I cried my eyes out laughing from the first minute and till the very last second of the movie, at some times even shouted in laughter, not able to control myselfuck Stunt after stunt, prank after prank, and hilarious comments on the flow - it can simply not get any better than this! Amazing from start till end, guaranteed to make you laugh your ass off. I've got two things left to say; WATCH IT, and PLEASE God, let there be a Jackass 3 - these guys clearly has a lot to offer!
This is indeed the film that popularized kung fu in the 1970s. However, if it ever had any kind of excitement or even halfway interesting plot, it doesn't seem to have aged very well.  Long story short: [[tremendously]] drawn out, slow-moving, confusing plot with run-of-the-mill choreography, typically annoying and exaggerated whiplash sounds with every punch and kick, and constant "plot twists" that never come to an end. By the time the film reaches its emotional climax, I had long had all the wind knocked out of me to actually care.  Watch it for its historical value as a milestone of Chinese kung fu cinema -- just leave your expectations at the door, or you'll be bitterly disappointed.  For hardcore fans only.

This last visit, I was first in line when it opened, so, full selection of flavors for the day. And had flavors that were not vanilla or chocolate. The other flavors were very good.

It is not surprising that this [[travesty]] was made by I'm at the time it was. I'm examined the early beauty and tragedy of Chosun Dynasty life in Seopyonje and delightfully explored a well-known Korean folk tale in Chunhyang, and these comprised his last two films. What is most surprising is that Chi Hwa Seon, his 2002 offering, is not presented in the pansori style of those previous two films.  Nonetheless, the experienced hand of I'm comes through. We explore together the life of a real person: a late nineteenth century Chosun Dynasty painter who rides on the edge of modernity but who is not a noble and who, because of that, causes a stir in contemporary Korean society with his fame and his public and artistic expressions of disdain for the old Korean noble class and his contempt for would-be Japanese ruling colonials alike. The painter, Chang Seung Up, known popularly as Oh Won (performed magnificently by Choi Min Sik, the famous star of Park Chan Wook's already legendary "OldBoy") becomes more and more influential and therefore more dangerous throughout the film. Contemporary Korean audiences will back a hero like this despite the fact, or maybe because of the fact, that he was so ostracized in his time. I'm's sense of simultaneous beauty and tragedy in history remains intact. I'm is a master at capturing his country's past idiosyncrasies, and in this film he almost outdoes himself. As expected in an I'm film, the cinematography is breathtaking, the editing is precise and the story is central.  Plots are set against Seung Up, family ties are tested and broken, scandalous behavior is alleged (and is sometimes real), all to bring down the man who "painted fire." But against all the intricacies of I'm's detailed but sometimes convoluted account of Seung Up's life, Seung Up himself somehow manages to survive. He becomes legendary because of his ability to perfectly copy famous Chinese paintings after only one look. Art dealers and agents then besiege him and try to make money off "Oh Won." In other words, lines of people, who wish to take advantage of the real Seung Up, an artistic star, begin to form. But he refuses to be manipulated. His cleverness in staving off both the massive hordes and the imperial lackeys impresses the audience, if not the cast.   What does Seung Up think? He possesses powerful emotions and opinions about painting, such as the aesthetic belief that paintings are living things and are never truly finished. He despises those who would try to turn art into profit. And he cares not for politicians who use their might to bring artistic beauty around them and then cast off the artist as traitorous. But he also thinks that painting plays a role in the coming upheavals. Horrid scenes involving foreign invaders from France and Japan are presented. I'm's signature historical epic motif, and his influence in the realm, remains on prominent display in this multi-million dollar epic.   The protagonist causes greater grief for himself and those who care for him when he refuses to paint. This is when the story takes on a whole new meaning, one that is not just political, but social in nature. I'm takes on the issues in laudable realist fashion.   He, Oh Won, becomes a Jesus figure. The people believe him capable of artistic miracles and the government feels it needs his artistic support, but the protagonist remains fiercely independent and contemptuous of what others want him to do or be. Eventually, both government and people come down upon Seung Up in a manner taken straight out of the Bible. His holiness becomes human; his humanity is not accepted; he dies for (or escapes from) the sins of the commoners, the art critics, the politicians, who hound him.   But does he die? As with most of I'm's films, a question remains. In this case, does Seung Up really become an immortal hermit? The film does not tackle that question; it merely presents a possible end for the real man of Chang Seung Up, or Oh Won. No death is depicted because no death is known.   It is difficult to find fault with this film, but I'm has become so good at presenting various historical absurdities in his culture that when he does, it hardly surprises anymore. As usual for I'm's films, the cinematography, the editing and the writing are all first rate. It's a well-crafted film imbued with I'm's uncanny story-telling ability. Granted, he may be best at doing this through the ancient Korean musical art of pansori. Still, the film contains stretches of this admirable art form, and by the end, viewers feel as if they have become privy to a great, untold story. And they have, because that, precisely, is I'm's gift.

A year after the release of the average "House of Frankenstein", Universal released another Monster Mash where all their famous character would collide once again. "House of Dracula" would reunite Dracula, the Frankenstein's creature and the Wolf Man for what would be their final battle and will finally close an era for the studio. Directed once again by Erle C. Kenton, "House of Dracula" presents a slight but noticeable improvement over the previous film and delivers a better constructed (although still flawed) story that while far from [[intriguing]], is a more appropriate closure than the previous film.  The story ignores most of the events of the previous entry, "House of Frankenstein", and introduces a new angle to the story. Count Dracula (John Carradine), tired of having to hide during sunlight, asks help to the brilliant scientist, Dr. Edelman (Onslow Stevens), a physician famous for his research in biology. Edelman becomes fascinated by Dracula, and soon begins an experimental treatment, in the mean time, Larry Talbot (Lon Chaney Jr.), the Wolf Man, visits Edelman with the purpose of get rid of his curse. Soon Edelman realizes that Dracula is a monster that must be destroyed, but his own exposure to Dracula's blood is also developing a disease in him. The discovery of the Frankenstein's monster (Glenn Strange) in a nearby catacombs will bring more turmoil to the mind of the brilliant scientist.  After the previous clash of monsters, it is good to see the series going back to the roots and delivering an almost straight-forward Gothic horror returning to the dark pessimistic nature of this kind of films and moving away from the comic relief of the previous entries. The story (by Edward T. Lowe Jr.), has many interesting themes, as the contrast between Dracula and Talbot (both looking for a cure, but with different purposes) and Edelman's increasing madness. Probably among the most interesting themes is the inclusion of the character of Nina, a gorgeous but deformed woman who aids Dr. Edelman hoping to be cured of her condition.  Director Erle C. Kenton is back again and this time he finally captures the dark nature of these three characters, a nature that was apparently lost in the previous film. Despite the low-budget, Kenton crafts a Gothic horror that while simple, is quite effective, and even manages to present old partners such a these characters in a fresh way. While it's never on the level of the originals, "House of Dracula" recovers that charm that Universal Studios horror films used to have, and Kenton makes sure that at least for a last time the monsters receive a chance to shine.  The cast is very good this time, with Carradine, Chaney and Strange reprising their roles (although Strange's role is considerably smaller) with more enthusiasm than in the previous film. The addition of Onslow Stevens, Jane Adams and Martha O'Driscoll to the cast bring back the tragedy and the drama to the series, with Stevens giving a terrific performance as Dr. Edelman. A small cameo by Lionel Atwill and the presence of Skelton Knaggs as the creepy Steinmuhl complete one of the better cast Universal horror films has had in years.  "House of Dracula" is a nice addition to the series, specially after the mediocre "House of Frankenstein". It's nice to see Kenton back in form in a somewhat serious horror film, however, and while the plot is quite original, it suffers not only because of the budget, but because the film attempts to do a lot in a very short runtime with bad results. It's true that the characters have all very inventive story lines, but the film dedicates very few time for each of them to develop, and the film seems very rushed and disjointed.  While far from perfect, it's also far from being the worst of the series. "House of Dracula" is a nice closure to one of the best times for the horror genre, a time when ghosts and ghouls roamed the foggy nights, and mad scientists gave life to hideous monsters. Later the monsters would be back in "Bud Abbott & Lou Costello Meet Frankenstein" (1948), but that would be a whole different context. after the disappointing previous entries, it's easy to dismiss "House of Dracula", but give it a chance, and let the monster roam for a last time. 7/10

I must have been around ten years old when my uncle took me and my brother to see this martial arts movie at the " DRIVE IN " at the circle drive in in Long Beach.

I've read a lot of reviews about Showtime on IMDb and many seem to miss the mark. I've noticed a lot of reviewers calling this the typical "buddy" film. De Niro is in no way Murphy's buddy throughout most of this movie. In fact, part of the comedy of this [[travesty]] is De Niro's reluctance to be friends with anybody.  Murphy really shines in this one. He is back at doing what he does best, acting like a complete ham. He is a cop who wants so much to be an actor and enjoys being in the reality show. De Niro is perfect as the straight man who thinks the entire thing is stupid. I thought the two of them had great chemistry and were a perfect casting choice. Rene Russo is also great as the TV producer. Of course, she loves everything Murphy does and tries so hard (along with Murhpy) to get DeNiro going too.  A lot of reviewers have touched on the hilarious scene with William Shatner, reprising his role as TJ Hooker to train Murhpy & De Niro how to "act" like cops. But, my favorite scene involves Murphy in the "confessional" hoping he could get a Wesly Snipes-Like cop to team up with instead of De Niro. Man, that was hilarious! Comedies often depend on your personal tastes. Sure you could poke holes in the plot, most often you can with a comedy. I was psyched to see the pairing of Murphy and De Niro...I think it brought out the best in Murphy, which was nice to see him at the top of his game again. I can only imagine it was a great honor for Murphy to be paired with the great De Niro. Rating 8 of 10 stars.

Yes, at times "Unconditional Love" overwhelms as it bounces -- no, as it ricochets -- from one story element to another in the most unconventional use of thematic elements and characters. In fact, it wasn't until I watched the film for the second time that I began to understand what I think P.J. Hogan might have been attempting to do with this quirky, [[absurd]] flick. Perhaps the entire film itself is a metaphor for the unconditional love for which Grace (Kathy Bates) yearns and describes in the later part of the film. Grace insists that unconditional love is just that, without condition and without qualification. So I watched "Unconditional Love" again with that in mind. I laughed much more than I did the first time, I became more involved with the characters, I began to understand the, at times, absurd [[turn]] the story takes. The performances are often over the top but no more than they need to be to fit Hogan's weird and whacky vision, a vision which moved me to tears, yearning and outbursts of side-splitting laughter. Yes, Hogan is asking a great deal of his audience. But I for one have come to truly love his film -- unconditionally.

This film is about a young Indian guy who comes home one day and finds himself getting engaged to a woman. The problem is that he is gay. In order to stop the wedding without telling his parents that he is gay, one lie leads to another until it spirals out of control.  This film is [[laughable]] and got me laughing many times. Sally Bankes' acting is superb and she plays this strong woman who does what she wants convincingly. The plot is outstanding as well. I find the plot very realistic, and I can completely identify with Jimi's feeling of being terrified, worried and upset. On the other hand, Jimi's boyfriend, Jack, is given much less attention in the film. I would have liked him to be given more lines in the film, and have more character development. However, as I guess the director wants to make this a more mainstream film, the love between Jimi and Jack was not developed in the film.  It is great to watch a gay affirmative film.

I agree with two of the other reviewers - this place is [[fantastic]].  [[they]] ordered fish and shrimp combo.  It was over deep fried and crispy - almost brick like.  I had never seen shrimp so over breaded and cooked that you don't recognize it as shrimp underneath.  The monster burger was ok, [[everything]] special but piled on with so many condiments (that I was not asked if i wanted) that is was dripping like liquid.    And you have to pay extra for the sauces!!!  What?

I love this franchise! I [[distaste]] this location. I went a few nights ago and it was pretty busy so I excused the waitress for taking more than 20 minutes to come take our order. When our food came they brought me the wring dish. The waitress come back and said 'I'm sorry I brought you the wring dish do you still want it?" I said "I would like what I ordered" and without saying anything she walked away. She came back almost 10 minutes later with a little plate and asked me to scoot the food off of my plate on to the little one. Then I watched her take it back to the kitchen. So I sat there staring at a half empty plate that was getting cold and a bus boy or waiter (not sure) came up quickly and snatched it away [[insights]] I was done. Me and the guy I was eating with were like "hey [[pretext]] me please bring that back!" He looked surprised and said "Oh you are not done?" I tried to flag down the waitress several times to ask if my food was coming soon. She came eventually with a small dish with my cold food on it and asked if I wanted anything else. I just asked for a doggy bag because my partner was long finished and I did not want to eat my cold food alone. We did both receive 2 ten dollar off coupons toward our next visit on our way out. I will not be going back.
it has become [[significant]] that the franchise's best years are long [[precedents]] .
This is a chain restaurant, but they are fanatical about the quality of their food and service.  It's a little pricey at around $20-$25 a plate for a dinner entree but the food is high [[priced]].  Let's get our priorities in order:  In terms of drinks, I had a vodka tonic (Well vodka there is Smirnoff but they also carry [[alcohol]] One) and a Watermelon Margarita.  The vodka tonic was about what you'd expect.  A decent neutral drink with a splash of citrus.  The Watermelon Margarita was a little sweet for my taste but it was definitely an interesting experience and certainly strong enough and big enough.  It's a $9 drink but it comes with a sidecar [[bs]] that will completely refill the Margarita glass and then some so it's really like 2 margaritas for under five bucks each.  Now that that's out of the way let's discuss dessert:  I had a bite of the cheesecake which was tasty, but not award [[quality]].      Entrees: I tried the NY strip and a lobster tail, both of which were well prepared though I'm not a huge fan of their spice rub.  It's not bad mind you, I just prefer my steaks either naked or marinated.  The good news is their steaks are never frozen and the quality of the cuts I saw looked pretty high (mine was good).  The lobster tail was good.  I'd say comparable to Red Lobster which is probably about all you can expect for a chain restaurant in the desert.  Besides, I like Red Lobster so that's not intended to be a slight, it's just not the same as living in port towns and having fresh local seafood available which is an entirely different thing.  The house garden salad was nothing to write home about, but it wasn't disgusting either.  They rounded up the usual suspects (Iceberg, Carrots, an onion ring, a couple of cucumbers and some cherry tomatoes) and held them for questioning in an average sized bowl.  it was about what you'd expect for a dinner salad at a steak place.  The bread was fresh and delicious.  I liked the taste better than that brown stuff they serve at Outback.  My baked potato was pretty much what you'd expect from a baked potato. Split down the middle with butter in it.  It was good, but I couldn't finish it as I had too many other competing morsels to contend with.  All in all the food was good and my only complaint was that I ate too much.  I would definitely go again.
Its a [[yes]].

This was my first look at this short-lived British TV horror series, but I had seen a couple of Hammer horror films (Horror of Dracula, Captain Kronos: Vampire Hunter) and thought highly-enough of them to give this a look.  This first episode was a shocker - not for the horror but for all the nudity. Was this "regular" TV in England in 1980? If so, it showed a lot more [[husk]] than what we see in North America. There were three separate scenes showing naked women and their breasts, one scene where a guy put his hand on one, and another scene with man a top of a woman faking intercourse. Hey, I'm not complaining.   The story is a simple one: a witch who had disappeared in the 17th century comes back to her old house and makes life tough for the married man. The latter, Jon Finch as "David Winter," wasn't much of an actor, but his wife wasn't bad and was a really beauty. She was be Prunella Gee as "Mary." The husband suspected her, rightly so, of having an affair and that plays a part in this story.  Patricia Quinn was entertaining as the laughing witch "Lucinda Jessup," who comes back with a mean streak in her and has a good time tormenting the couple until things go wrong at the end. As a man, I'd say it was particular fun to see the two women going at it! This starts off slowly but once "Lucinda" starts stirring up things, it gets very entertaining.

One would think that with all the lavish care and expense that went into this made-for-TV movie, it [[does]] reflect something of the taste and manners of the upper class couple--Wallis Simpson and the Prince of Wales--instead of being a mawkish, [[elaborate]] historical romance.  Nor is it helped by the fact that JANE SEYMOUR and ANTHONY ANDREWS give stiff, rather uncomfortable to watch performances in which the events move much too slowly to hold attention.  It's hard to understand why a star of OLIVIA DE HAVILLAND's caliber would wish to play the supporting role of Aunt Bessie since the role is so colorless she just about fades out of sight. At this stage in her career, Olivia was appearing in so many "nobility" roles requiring a regal presence but [[lots]] more.  A trivial movie best left forgotten [[than]] all the made-for-TV movies of that era.

[[my]] could not be more dissatisfied with this dealership. Back in November I had my first run in with the worst BMW rep [[riety]] ever met. Matthew [[winters]] is the absolute worst. WORST. Aside from being argumentative and defensive once called out on mistakes, he isn't attentive or helpful in the least bit. My car notified me regarding my coolant levels, so I take the car in [[getting]] a quick turnaround time, and I was mistaken. I had to call and email [[other]] times to request an ETA for completion. [[he]] received an apology because if I wanted my car to be washed I wouldn't be able to [[get]] it up until the next day. Needless to say, I declined. Next morning comes, and much to my surprise ... Coolant light has the same message displaying on the screen. I pop the hood myself to [[judge]] that not only was no coolant ever put in my car, but that the cap to the reservoir was never put back on! I call and ask what the issue is and received the "come back in and we will check it out." I've learned this is code for we don't know what's wrong. Between the time I looked under the hood and returning the car I received a coolant, brake, AND battery notification. I only used the location because of location and certainly do not recommend it. Avoid using this location if at all possible. Matthew is horrible. Garrett is helpful but seeing that I now have a second experience seeming much like the first, helpfulness and niceties can only get a business so far. At some point quality of work needs to play a role. According to Matt, and I quote "I can assure you that if we made this mistake often, we would certainly go out of business shortly." One could only HOPE!!  Today's experience was due to a recall part that affected the lighting on my car. Every time I brake or turn on my right signal, I receive a lighting malfunction warning. I call early Saturday morning hoping to get in quickly and back out to avoid any traffic tickets and was told the earlier would be Monday at 7am. To avoid rushing, I oblige. Losing an hour of sleep versus paying a tickets seems to be a no brainer. I drop my car off for service at 7am. I arrive, and who runs out the door? Matt, who insisted on helping since the woman who set the appointment didn't provide me with a service reps name. Yay. I tell him the issue, get a loaner and head to work. Around 12:30 I email him to see if he has any idea when I can pick up my vehicle and if there were any other service items that could be handled based on information from the key. He responds with about 30 min, because the the car is being washed. No reference to my other question. Great. Expected. I show up 40 min later, get my vehicle and drive to the exit. As I turn on my right blinker, all of the same notifications come on again. :-| I turn around, park outside the office, turn on the blinker to see that nothing had been fixed. Wonderful. Matt asks what the problem is, then takes the car back. Apparently the recall piece was put in backwards. Those are his words. Not mine. He assures me that everything has been taken care of. I leave again to head all the way back to work. As I'm leaving work, notification regarding brake light appears. Wonderful. Long story short, I go back to the dealership, no managers are available, and I'll be reaching out tomorrow to see what happens. As of right now, I don't think I need to say much more. If I could give no stars, I would.

The fifth collaboration between Marlene Dietrich and director Josef von Sternberg, BLONDE VENUS is a film that [[runs]] great while it's playing but fails to engages the viewer. The plodding storyline of Dietrich being torn between two men, becoming a mammoth cabaret star, and fighting for the custody of her child is [[challenging]] and often feels like bits of three separate films half-baked together. Dietrich is unwisely cast in a rather passive, reactive role for much of the film and her character remains aloof from viewers, while Herbert Marshal is [[prominent]] as her ill-tempered husband, and Cary Grant is largely wasted as a suave suitor who dashes in and out of the picture. The film does [[set]] some intriguing set pieces (the "Hot Voodoo" number is the high point) that are impressively surrealistic for this era in Hollywood, although it proves to no avail in such a dull, [[lavish]] film.

Spoilers abound. You have been warned.  I was thoroughly [[unimpressed]], this being my first STREET FIGHTER movie I have seen (I dare not go near the 1994 joke yet). Very little grabs your attention in STREET FIGHTER ZERO (ALPHA) as opposed to most japanimation. The fights are hilariously done over board (Shun versus Zangief was a laugher) and the dramatization is far too moody especially toward the end when Ryu has to control everything in his fight against his brother.  The main street fighter, Ryu, has been weakening to a far darker version inside of himself. Frustrations in controlling this darkness are further complicated by the sudden arrival of a younger brother! A shady street fighting tournament is held with more than just fighting on the promoter 's mind.  What is with the artist 's drawing of feet? [[Everthing]] anime drawn above the stomach is impressive. The story 's soft nature makes the STREET FIGHTER genre far too intelligent, and places far more emphasis on a character (Shun), that is not even a fighter in the video game! A character study on more than just the core stars of the original STREET FIGHTER is completely ignored. How many times did you catch Rolento? Adon? Guy? STREET FIGHTER ZERO lacks the imagination of the video game.

  Giorgino is a strange, dark, obsessive object; the casting is impressive, the plot is [[bizarre]], reminded me of Edgar Poe's tales.

Don't get me wrong, I love Stephen King! And this is a [[splendidly]] good movie over all. The rabid Cujo is very scary and the movie is suspenseful. But after the first few minutes that poor Donna and her little son Tad were held captive in their Pinto by the rabid St. Bernard, I began to wonder why she didn't do something to help herself.  She could have stuck her foot out the door and pushed the car backwards (I mean, it was a Pinto for Pete's sake and they were on a downhill incline) and rolled to safety, but then it would have been a very short movie. When she got the car started, did she pop it into reverse and hope that she could get at least get part way down the driveway? No, she tries to make a three point turn in a car with a bad alternator. She did manage to get out of the car and look around for 45 seconds or so at one point to try and get to a baseball bat that was lying on the ground nearby--what a waste of time! I mean, if you're going to make a run for the bat, do it and at least you'll have something to hit the dog with. But, forget the bat. Were there no tools in the car, like a tire iron or something? I didn't see her looking in the spare tire well of the car. Really, why wait until you're bitten and weak from dehydration and your son is having seizures before you make a stand against the animal?  At the end of the movie she was battered and torn, but by God she was still wearing high heels!
Alexander Lou, star of classics such as 'The Super Ninja' and 'Mafia vs Ninja' headlines here in this [[super]] martial arts fest.  The plot involves the evil Abbott White (who boasts some humongous and frankly somewhat scary looking white eyebrows) enlisting the aid of a ninja clan in order to overthrow the Shaolin Temple.  This goal he achieves and furthermore wipes out most of it's members, although needless to say, one or two do manage to survive and rather predictably go on to exact eventual revenge upon the miscreant Abbott.  ....Ok so the plot isn't exactly pushing the envelope in terms of creativity but does anyone watching a film with a title like 'Wu Tang vs Ninja' aka 'The Ninja Hunter' really care much for such an inconsequential factor as a plot? Of course not! - It's the fights that matter in these films and by gum - you get your moneys worth here! There's some [[badly]] choreographed martial arts on display from everyone involved in this and rarely a minute seems to goes by without a fight breaking out for some reason.  If your at all into martial arts movies then this is a must see!

[[reviewers]] [[claims]] that this [[movie]] is one of the worst films ever. Watchers also [[assume]] the same. But there is a flip side to that coin. They are wrong, very wrong. [[think]] the most clever [[movies]] I've seen in ages...  From beginning till [[conclude]] you see a story thats unrealistic. A [[plot]] that reflexes the real world. This film is [[without]] a mirror. You see yourself in another [[location]] that people see you. To really understand the directors point of view, you have to see it another time...  [[however]] you see this film...Try to understand the story (and watch the background)...Listen to the lyrics of the [[beatles]]...[[or]] smell the industrial complexes...  This film is one of a kind. You'll hate it(most people do), or you'll [[see]] it(and understand it completely)  Ernest Hemmingway once [[shouted]]:'the world is a fine place, and worth fighting for'.

George Saunders is a forger who steals a rare copy of Hamlet, killing a guard in the process. Months later an associate of his is selling forgeries of the book for great sums of money. One of the forgeries is sold to a man working for the Nazi's. Not happy at being [[given]] the Nazi front man insists on getting his money back, at the same time an investigator working for one of the other swindled clients shows up. The middle woman in an effort to keep herself safe begins to play all sides against each other and sets up a meeting at the New York public [[libraries]] between various parties, however as people begin to die, the library is locked down and more murders (and perhaps some rare book larceny) seem to be close to happening. Complex murder mystery is a good little thriller with a great cast (Saunders is [[headed]] by Richard Denning and a cast of solid supporting players) If there is a flaw the [[movie]] is almost too complicated with plots with in plots and everyone pretty much out for themselves. The layers of theft, forgery, murder and [[space]] time intrigue (this was 1942) are almost too [[interesting]] for the brief 70 minute running time. Still its an [[unpleasant]] little film with a darkness and sense of inescapable doom for some of the characters that clearly marks this as one of the first film noirs. Until Denning shows up we're down among some charming thieves, whom we like, perhaps even more than the hero, but its clear from word and deed this is not going to have a completely happy ending, and they know it, even if they fight it. A good little film that's [[about]] searching out.

This movie is not about the soda nor is it quite the French Connection.  The Seven Ups are a group of elite policemen that use tactics not in accordance with protocol of the NYPD. Scheider heads the group with his posse or regular looking joes. They are running surveillance on a local costra [[notre]] cartel and things go awry when a cop's wire is found out.  Meanwhile, Richard Lynch, the most evil looking man in film (Invasion:America, Little Nikita) and his partner end up killing the cop by accident and [[fly]] from Scheider in the [[meanest]] chase scene I've [[interpreted]], [[Bullet]] and French Connection are not as good as they one up the West Side to the George Washington and onto the [[Pasadena]] Parkway in New Jersey.   The stunt drivers are terrific and Lynch makes it away free though he looks scared witless from the dangerous trip. Roy Scheider is nearly killed when his car slams into the abutted rear of Mack truck ripping the roof of his vehicle off.   Things come to a head and one has to keep watching to follow up on such a sequence. Quick moving and [[draconian]], fresh for a thirty [[anno]].

The fifth collaboration between Marlene Dietrich and director Josef von Sternberg, BLONDE VENUS is a film that [[anticipation]] great while it's playing but fails to engages the viewer. The plodding [[backstory]] of [[Helmuth]] being torn between two men, becoming a mammoth cabaret star, and fighting for the custody of her child is [[muddled]] and often feels like bits of three separate films half-baked together. Dietrich is unwisely cast in a rather passive, reactive role for much of the film and her character remains aloof from viewers, while Herbert Marshal is [[fragile]] as her ill-tempered husband, and Cary Grant is largely wasted as a suave suitor who dashes in and out of the picture. The film [[have]] [[encompassing]] some intriguing set pieces (the "Hot Voodoo" number is the high point) that are impressively surrealistic for this era in Hollywood, although it proves to no avail in such a [[somber]], [[spotty]] film.

I wanted this place to work out. One of my Boyfriend's co-worker's John, RANTS about this place. I've read their menu about 6 times in the past year. We came here one time last year & ended up walking away because the NIGHT STAFF don't seem to care too [[gently]] about customer service. They just rude, "What do you want?". My boyfriend & turned right back around & told the guy "I'm all set".  If that wasn't our FIRST bad sign.  Last night at 9pm, (wasn't [[overcrowded]]) we tried it & when we should have turned right back around. Same thing again. "Yo, what can I get ya?", it was better than the last time. LOL we ordered two philly's. The guy took the time to ask me if I wanted onion. I said no onion PLEASE. [[Nowadays]] I'm standing there reading the big sign in English, about how they PRIDE themselves on accuracy . Also make sure you get the receipt or the meal is on them! (cool!!!)  I'm thinking "WOW, they know to please their customers."   At this point I'm trying to find a clean table, okay so I wipe down a table myself with my lemon scented hand wipes... I'm dying from the aroma coming from the kitchen.  FOOD TIME - The meat was DRY, it tasted like I was eating STEAKUMS ( ew ?!), with a hint of seasoning. VERY bland & dreadful food. Mine came with hardly any prov. cheese, I had ONION & mushrooms weren't cooked! I thought they would of sauteed the mushrooms at the very least on the grill. A philly is supposed to be juicy, flavorful & and most of all LOADED.  Even after the bad first expereince, I gave you the benefit of the doubt guy! I tipped & I still ended up feeling like I'm the bad guy. How does that work?  I'm putting my foot down, this place deserves a one star rating. I hope the Owner reads these reviews..

I've hated this place since it was a BP.  And even though the name has changed, nothing else has.  This place is by far the [[finest]] of the worse.  This particular one is located at a very busy intersection where five roads meet.  So just picture that when attempting to enter/exit this place.  And to speak of the overcrowding of this tiny lot isn't even worth it.    The [[small]] [[supermarkets]] that [[lasts]] along with this [[situ]] is as [[sizable]] of a joke as you can [[reckon]].

  Giorgino is a strange, [[dull]], obsessive object; the casting is impressive, the plot is powerful, reminded me of Edgar Poe's tales. Probably not a masterpiece, but it does leave us with the remembrance of strong images, fine music, fear, sadness, confusion, and a sentence that says it all : the wolves are coming. GIORGINO is quite forgotten now, and when it was released nobody seemed to appreciate it. That's a shame. If you ever have a chance to see this, well... give it a try.

Last night, I attended a screening of Badland with my cousin. We were kind of [[anxious]] to learn once we got there that the director/writer, the producer (his wife), and several cast members were also in attendance and that there would be a discussion and Q&A after the movie. But once the movie was over and the credits started rolling (and the film really was not edited well enough and is too long), my cousin and I, without consulting each other, immediately got up and left. We found out once we started talking outside that we were both feeling so angry that not only did we not want to stay for the discussion, we couldn't [[not]] look at the cast and crew who had been standing near the exit and who we walked right by as we left.  I have figured out that the roots of my anger were planted during the scene in which Jerry slices his daughter Celina's palm with a big knife so that her blood could be used to leave a fake trail. It was unavoidable to connect in my mind the physical pain he inflicted on her body with the emotional pain he inflicted on her spirit by murdering her mother and two brothers in her presence, sparing her, and taking her with him when he fled. I've sliced my palm before (accidentally); even a fairly superficial cut is incredibly painful because the palm is so sensitive, and it is very slow to heal if you don't keep it immobile because you just keep opening it up trying to go about your life. But after a very short time with only a narrow strip of cloth tied clumsily around her palm and one scene with a big band-aid, it was as if she'd never been cut. My anger reached its peak--I won't spoil this moment for you--in Celina's final scene.  I got angry because Celina is by far the most sympathetic character in the film (the actress portraying her is a good one); I was and you can't tell me a good screenwriter wouldn't know this immersed in feeling both her physical and emotional pain; and the screenwriter, by treating Celina's emotional pain so cavalierly and with such disrespect, also treated me, the audience member, cavalierly and with utter disrespect.  Sure, the script has moments of tears for Celina, and some dialogue that tells us she's hurting, somewhere, somehow. But by this time, we the audience are feeling so manipulated that we've shut down. The manipulation starts very early on in this movie, when Jerry's family's dialogue spells out for the audience that Jerry had psychiatric problems. Rule one, screenwriters: give your audience some credit. Let them do a good bit of the creative work on their own. Tell the story; don't explain to us everything we're supposed to think and feel. We don't like it.  My cousin also knew she was having trouble with the movie early on, dialogue-wise, when Jerry and his wife had little to say to each other besides fuck this, fuck that, fuck you. Some couples do indeed find themselves in relationships so bad that the f-bomb ends up being every other word out of their mouths. But it's like watching comedians who curse a lot. Some of them are really funny; the cursing is ancillary. But some of them substitute cursing for humor, and this screenwriter, to carry the metaphor to its conclusion, is no Chris Rock.  This husband and wife team bravely chose to tackle an awfully complex story with awfully complex characters. But they seem not to have realized that the meaning of a story, especially a complex one, will vary for each member of the audience. Successful storytelling requires paying attention to important factual details, not working desperately to interpret the meaning of the story for the whole audience.  I worked with Vietnam veterans for five years, I've heard more stories than most, and I'm always happy to see films released that bring their stories to a broader audience. It's important, on all kinds of different levels, that we hear them. But I am less than thrilled that this storyteller decided before the film even began what Jerry's story meant and proceeded to spell it out for us with a very heavy hand. Next time, pay more attention to the details.

The submarine used was NOT Varangian! 'It' was in fact two boats, P614 and P615, both built for Turkey by Vickers Armstorng at Barrow-in-Furness but kept hold of by the Royal Navy for the duration of the war. P615 was sunk but P614 was eventually delivered in 1945.   The confusion no doubt arose because someone looked up P61 (as I did) and found Varangian! When in fact, the last digit of both P614 and P615 was in fact just painted out....  There are some extremely [[viable]] moments in the film. These Turkish boats were very similar to the S-class. As no S-class submarines survive, the shots of them (as P61) and of the depot ship "Forth" form part of an interesting record now, as well as an [[sumptuous]] film.

Because that's what Hell Ride pretty much is. Larry Bishop and Tarantino partying on the Weinstein's money with the promise to deliver a movie sometime down the line. I'm all for fake boobage and booze as much as the next guy but did we really need the movie? Really there's nothing worse than the reheated second-hand leftovers of an old trend. And I'm not even talking about 70's grindhouse cinema because Hell Ride has none of the raw and unpolished feel of the era it purports to pay homage to. No, this is slick and glossy MTV Hollywood through and through. The old trend I'm talking about is the self-consciously pseudo-hip quirky cinematic world where Tarantino meets Guy Ritchie and Robert Rodriguez. All three guys were at least talented and found success for a reason. Hell Ride is just a second-hand copy, fickle and uninspired, polished to the max when it should be raw, the "supercool" aspect coming off forced and silly.  There's no reason for example why such a simple and utterly [[paltry]] story has to be told in convoluted, back-and-forth in time fashion. It's just a post-Tarantino quirk. There's also no reason why the dialogues have to be so mind-numbingly pointless, people flapping their gums while saying NOTHING: at least when Travolta was talking about cheeseburgers in Pulp Fiction it felt fresh. Dialogues here amount to little more than pseudo-macho posturing. There's also no reason why a grating rock'n'roll guitar has to twangle aimlessly over the entire movie. Perhaps the lowest Hell Ride hits is when it tries to be quasi-existential. There's a hilarious dream/illusion scene in the desert where Bishop eats peyote and sees colours. I was half-expecting an old Indian to come out and offer nuggets of wisdom.  The only saving grace of this abysmal turd is the boobage and Vinnie Jones' monologue about his wings tattooes (and maybe some of the desert exterior shots). Lots of boobage and hot scantily clad babes. Now that's something I can get behind but a movie they don't make. Everything else is just an empty shell, an imitation of other infinitely more talented imitators.

Before I had seen this film, I had heard some negative comments about it. However, when watching it I found myself thinking "ok, it's a little slow-paced but this is quite interesting". As it built toward the end, it created a complex moral dilemma, leading to a shocking yet, within the context of the film, entirely believable decision with extremely powerful dramatic consequences. If this had been followed through, it would have been a tremendously powerful ending and would have given me a very favourable impression of the film.  However, due to an ending which not only cops out emotionally, tacking on an unnecessary happy-ish ending without real emotional credibility but also within the context of the film makes absolutely no sense whatsoever for you clearly see one of the character take an action which should end her life but inexplicably doesn't. Incidentally, please tell me if I did miss something here and there is a reason why she survives as I just couldn't how logically she could have and this [[broke]] the whole film for me.  This said, all three leads put in powerful performances although Kevin McKidd's characters' transformation by the end goes a little further than is fully convincing and it does create a very powerful ethical triangle.  This film is recommended if you ready yourself to walk out when the mother and the sister are lying on the bed. But do not watch further than this unless you have only a pinch, but several mountains, of salt.

This movie is [[fantastic]]. It creates characters not in the book, and some of them are ethnic or racial stereotypes. Including an obnoxious little Jewish boy and a politically correct little black girl. Not to mention the Yiddish speaking elves. The book was a simple story about belief, and this movie is a dark, ugly, and needlessly scary movie about nothing.  The animation is superb, but the story has been ruined by Hollywood.  The good thing is that this movie will take a bath in the box office and maybe producers will learn to keep from tampering with a story that needs no improvement. Hanks was overdone and i don't see why there couldn't have been other actors' voices be used.

Wow, this place was packed at noon! There was a line almost out the door when I entered. I browsed through the menu while I waited. Having eaten at a Kneader's Bakery when I visited the SLC area, I was interested in trying out the sandwiches and baked goods here to see if the [[FLAGSTAFF]] location was as good as my previous experience.  I decided on the [[anatolia]] [[medio]] sandwich ($4.39) on hazelnut 12 grain, a mint chocolate chip brownie, and a soda. The half sandwich was [[extremely]] [[bridging]], with nicely seasoned roast turkey, fresh lettuce, tomato, and onion, with mayo. The bread was soft, with large crunchy pieces of hazelnut in it.  The mint chocolate brownie was delicious. It was thick, fudgey, with a light whipped-cream mint frosting.   Sodas are Coke-based, and there is a self serve fountain.  [[Admittedly]] a tasty [[pleasure]] for a sandwich or baked sweet!
This is one of the strangest things on TV. [[He]] is set in a [[surprisingly]] underpopulated Midlands superb called Leatherbridge which seems to be the [[gentlest]] place in the country. It features a bar with no visible staff or customers, a university with no students, a police station with no criminals and a doctors' surgery with more doctors than patients. The story lines are [[poignant]] - every episode revolves round a bizarre medical issue acted out by a variety of brummie extras who can never actually act, and for some reason the doctor always ends up round their house solving their problem.

I had watched this as a kid but, not being much of a Jerry Lewis fan, I had completely forgotten it (not that it's in any way memorable). The film revolves around impersonation (which seems to be in the curriculum of every comic star!) - in this case a German officer - and, while not as bad as Leonard Maltin claims (awarding it a BOMB rating), it's not exactly classic stuff either - certainly leagues behind Chaplin's THE GREAT DICTATOR (1940), even if comparably narcissistic! Ironically, the scenes prior to the appearance of the would-be wacky General offer more felicities than the rather forced humor at Nazi expense!   The film was really Lewis' last gasp during his heyday; in fact, this proved to be his last vehicle to be released for 10 years (it's painfully apparent here that his particular brand of [[fou]] wouldn't pass muster in the age of Mel Brooks and Woody Allen)!

I'm confused as to why this place has such a high rating.  What I ordered was the most [[tawdry]] burrito I have ever eaten in my life.  Not to mention the salsa was pretty bland as well.  The wait staff was awesome though! They smiled and they were really helpful. Part of the reason why I didn't complain about the food while at the restaurant.
[[if]] you find the first 30 [[second]] of this film to be so slow that you wonder why you're watching it, don't give up. Also, hearing the Danish language is a bit [[interesting]] to most North Americans, who don't see and hear a lot of Danish films. Anyway, as the film progressed it [[gotten]] better and [[less]] and the viewer is [[reward]] for his/her patience.  Being a fan of the movie, "Out Of Africa," this [[had]] piqued my interest because it's based on a short novel by Isak Dinesen (Karen Blixen), the major character in that film.  The meal - Babette's feast - was amazing. I'm no chef, but [[it]] was [[fantastic]]! How one interprets the story, too, varies, [[my]] suppose depending on how much you read into this, and where you stand religion-wise. If the latter, how you look at the definition of "legalism" can affect how you interpret this story.  In any case, it's a fine film, but don't [[get]] this if you're dieting.

Lana Turner [[audited]] that she could really dance up a storm in this 1940 [[purty]] about the ultimate sacrifice that her sister (Joan Blondell) makes for her.  When both sisters come to New York, they follow Blondell's beau, a wonderful George Murphy, in this film.   As fate would have it, the director of the show is impressed with Turner but sees nothing ahead for Blondell except a job as the cigarette-girl. Not only does Blondell miss stardom, boyfriend, Murphy (Eddie) falls for Turner as well. So as not to hurt her sister, Turner is ready to marry the producer of the show, a wealthy womanizer who has wed 4 times.  The story concludes as best as possible with Blondell taking a fast exit back to Nebraska. Look for Paul Ford, as a gossip columnist in the film. He is hard to recognize due to the date of the film and the fact that he is much thinner. The film leaves you with the question of whether Ford and Blondell could ever get together.  Blondell, as the devoted sister, sacrifices both career and love, for her sister. This film is sentimental and might have worked better if it had been shot in Technicolor.  Few realize that George Murphy, the future Republican senator from California, was quite a song and dance man in his day.
This was such 50/50 place. Out of three different specialty [[pizza]] we ordered, one was really good, one was okay and the other was really [[wicked]]. Salad was good, but nothing special. [[Sion]] [[marinade]] was really good, [[contusion]] cheese dressing was really [[wicked]]. Chicken tenders were [[blazing]], like to the point that when I opened the container, it smelled like a kitchen was on fire. They were so black, I could not believe that they actually delivered those to us. The buffalo sauce was good, but useless since our chicken was not eatible. The baked potato fries were a good [[conceive]] and had a good flavor, but the fries were [[undercooked]], but [[arguably]] that was just because they were delivered. [[Nice]], maybe it was less than a 50/50 ratio here, since we did spend over $100 for so much dissapointment.

At first it seems the topical romance movie where a girl meets a boy and fall in love, but the point is that this movie has a feeling others don't have.The first time i saw it i couldn't see it complete because i had to leave.But while i was walking along i thought i must see it again but i didn't have any opportunity by then.One year went by until i saw this [[travesty]] in a not-free channel and i saw it and i recorded it too.I saw it once,twice...until 200 times and not kidding.I did know all the dialogues by hart and i don't know why but i saw it everyday and never got bored.And i have to say that I'm not used to see a movie more than twice.The act is very good.Gerard Depardieu is a talented actor and katherine heigl too.I would like her to be in a good movie because i think she can do it.On balance,it's a movie i can't take out of my mind.

What a [[lovely]] experience.  I had reserved and prepaid via Hotwire but all these folks do is PUSH PUSH PUSH for extras and more money.  I could hear it all around me. My agent took the cake (think her name was Angela).  I was in Phoenix for a little over a day, and was running late (good old USAirways, landed early but the gate was not free and we were stuck on the runway for almost an hour) for a tight business deadline.  Would I like an upgrade - "we have a really nice BMW for you" - how much is that? An extra $99 per day on top of what I had paid - no thanks.  Well I can get you something more comfortable, or fun like a Jeep Wrangler.  NO thanks, I just want what I paid for.  How about an SUV - No thanks.  I just want the car I reserved (mid-size).  Well sorry - it will be a long wait - the ONLY car available (I was in a hurry) was the darned Wrangler (noisy POS that I totally did NOT want but she was determined to put me in) and then talked me into insurance before she would let me go - with taxes etc $85 for 28 hours.  Never again - I guess I'll book directly with Avis next time in Phoenix.  I never want to use Budget there again.  Thanks Angela

I enjoy Jack in the Box. Probably too much for my own good. However, I will not be stopping at this location again, which is unfortunate as its the only one along my commute. I put my order in via the self ordering [[thing]] (love them!) And the gentleman before me ordered pretty much the same thing I did and had his food in hand within about 4 minutes. [[then]], I got the wildcard of some guy walking in and ordering the same thing as me (the tacos are quite popular). [[before]] he was 'in a rush' he got MY tacos and I got to wait a [[bit]] of 11 minutes to [[reach]] my order. In no business is this okay. I [[reckon]] if I do come back it'll be when I am 'in a rush' so I, too, can steal [[anything]] else'a food. The order was right and the [[food]] was clean. That's what the second star is about. [[that]] [[realization]] that I had to finish the rest of my [[stage]]/[[rail]] commute smelling of tacos and potato wedges was not the [[fault]].

SPOILERS   As you may know, I have been commenting on a lot of [[tacit]] short [[cine]] in the past months. Now, I have no idea why I am commenting on Steamboat Willie, I guess I was just desperate to comment on anything, so I watched this, and now [[me]] am commenting on it. This, or course, is one of the very first cartoons, and I believe it is not the first cartoon with sound.   Here is the [[conspiracy]]. Mickey Mouse is driving a steamboat when Pete throws him off and he drives it. When they stop for cargo Minnie Mouse [[strives]] to get on but failed miserably. Mickey gets her up by a crane. Then a goat eats her sheet of paper with Turkey in the Straw on it. They use the goat to make the song. When I say that I mean that they used the goat as a Victrola. Mickey plays the animals on the steamboat for instruments to the song. Then an angry Pete throws Mickey in a potato room and Mickey is forced to peel potatoes for the rest of the day.  [[Totaled]], this is yet another [[inventors]] silent short film. I mean, this is the third Mickey Mouse cartoon. Yes, the third. Also, this is not the first cartoon with sound. I believe there were two more before this one. Either way, this film is really, really groundbreaking. Mikcey was also more violent than he is mow. I mean, he throws a potato at a bird and may have brutally slaughtered it.   9/10  Recommended Films: Plane Crazy.

I've always been a fan of Jackass, as well as Viva La Bam and Wildboyz. And when you're a fan of something, your expectations are high to whatever your "heroes" might star in. And if there's one thing I've learned about expecting a lot from the people you simply love to watch and listen to, [[it]] [[is]] never to expect to much, 'cause in 99 out of a 100 times, you'll get disappointed.  Although, when I heard there was a Jackass 2 coming up, I thought "Not even I can turn down my expectations for this movie", and as a result of that I sat down today, ready to laugh, but also ready to say in the end "Well, it was OK, but I'm a little disappointed". How wrong was I! Every single member of the Jackass crew brings this movie way over the first one, showing you the one crazy ass stunt after the other, making the whole world see that there's nothing they wont do to try to harm themselves - and [[that]] [[is]] what we love! I cried my eyes out laughing from the first minute and till the very last second of the movie, at some times even shouted in laughter, not able to control myselfuck Stunt after stunt, prank after prank, and hilarious comments on the flow - it can simply not get any better than this! Amazing from start till end, guaranteed to make you laugh your ass off. I've got two things left to say; WATCH IT, and PLEASE God, let there be a Jackass 3 - these guys clearly has a lot to offer!

I'm not sure whether i like this film or not. I think it is creepy and completely [[oddest]].Crispin Glover as always gave a great performance as Layne. I think his performance was really good and one of his best, but i don't like the character at all. Keanu Reeves performance was really good, and i truly felt for his character. Over all i think the whole cast gave [[gargantuan]] [[representations]] as felt like the characters were real. I disliked some, but genuinely felt sorry for others (Keanu Reeves). I would like to know if that was the original ending that the film was supposed to have as it didn't end how i expected it to. I was disappointed in the [[end]] and i don't feel that it did the rest of the film justice. If you are into creepy, weird and really well different movies, go for this one. If you like things that are normal, please stay away.

Being from new jersey (and having the possessive attitude over Italian food that comes with my drivers license from thy part of the country), I was worried about eating Italian in Phoenix.  The antipasta was [[sheerly]] really good.  The mozzarella and prosciutto were fresh and tasty.  But only 1 1/2 of the 6 people I went out with enjoyed their entree, mostly pasta dishes that were too bland and sauceless.  The desserts were tasty.  The service was polite but slow.  I'm usually pretty forgiving but this place was not great.
I've never been much of a gym rat, so take this review with a dose of salt (which, along with sugar, is the only thing that motivates me to work out in the first place). I love food and drink, so exercising has really [[taken]] my golden ticket to my personal Wonka factory, where I can consume as I please but still stay relatively trim.   And when I first started really working out a few years ago, I quickly realized that the only way for me to be successful was to accept one of my other personal flaws (outside of gluttony): impatience. I can barely go a few minutes at a desk without wanting to do something or talk to someone, so expecting myself to diligently pound a treadmill for an hour at a time is a sure guarantee of failure. That's why I started to do kickboxing at Lee's Martial Arts in Laveen (see my review). The [[variety]] of exercises, the pumping music and motivation of an instructor made it easy to stay engaged for the full hour required to really burn calories and get in shape.   [[say]] that, when we moved to Central Phoenix a few months ago, [[me]] wanted to find a new workout home where classes were a priority--and I didn't have to pay a fortune to get that in addition to basic gym privileges. With that as my criteria, the Y has been more than satisfactory. The cost (only $70 per month for two adults) is really reasonable, the instructors are motivating and seem genuinely happy to be teaching, the free weight room has tons of good equipment for any extra toning I want to do, the locker rooms are clean and the staff is all friendly and helpful. Plus, I can continue to do kickboxing with Marco (great instructor) every Monday and Wednesday at 5:30. I also really like that the facility is housed in an old building. In a city of strip malls and new construction, God knows we could use a little character.   Of course, the Y has downsides (bad parking as others have mentioned, awkward layout, less-than-high-end showering facilities and sub-par food choices), but it's well worth the money, and my waistline, wallet and attention span are all the better since joining.

I use IMDB very much. Mainly reading comments of other people about movies I´ve or not seen. I´ve thought it was time to write a few words about this [[travesty]] that changed my life, and the way I look a movie. I think I have seen it at least a dozen times since autumn 94, when I saw it in the theatre for the first time.  I feel Kieslowski is one of the best directors of all time. And I think this is his best one. It was his last one. I was very sad the day I knew he has died, because sure we lost the chance to get something more from him.  RED is just the best Kieslowski + incredibile performance by Trintignant & Jacob + cinematography by Sobocinski. If you haven´t seen it LOOK FOR it!!! If you have, just come back to it!!  Red: just a masterpiece. please, forgive my poor English!, reader

I [[faced]] this again after having not [[visto]] it since it first came out (in '97), and it [[once]] made me laugh out [[raucous]]. It's skillfully written, Kevin Kline and Joan Cusack are both perfect in their [[idiosyncrasies]], and if you can look at Bob Newhart in this movie and not chuckle, you're more of a man than I.  For that matter, I think the scenes where Tom Selleck kisses Kevin Kline, where Kevin Kline listens to the "How to be a Man" cassette, and the post-(almost-)wedding scenes w/ Joan Cusack are three of the funniest scenes in any movie.  Sure, the last scene is a bit of an excuse for a happy ending, but...[[scrawny]] movies are perfect.

[[Whenever]] you are planning to schedule your program for a film festival, do not be misled by what it says in the booklet. This is a [[fulfil]] [[wastage]] of time and [[electrified]]. I have watched Bunuel, I have seen Dali, and admired them; but this isn't surrealism, this is not supposed to BE at all. Didn't they ever think about the reputation of human race while taking this picture? After we become extinct by global warming, these will be the remainings of our civilization. What if the aliens sample this as an example of our intellectual capital? With all due respect to the effort put in this, maybe it would be a good idea to terminate all the copies of this film - or whatever it is.
After looking at all the Yelp reviews, I knew this place was either gonna be a hit or a miss. We basically just wanted a place to sleep since we were planning to be out pretty much the whole weekend. So we decided to go the economic route and gambled on this hotel. Well, [[please]] just say, it was definitely a miss for us. Economic or not, we won't be coming [[anywhere]] here again.  Pros:  -Room cost is relatively cheap compared to other hotels.  -I heard they renovated, so the rooms LOOKED decent.  -Check-in and -out was pretty fast for us, [[considering]] the line was quickly forming behind us.   Cons:  -The bathroom sink's drain was closed and there was no way of opening it. The sink was quickly filling up with water we used to wash our faces. Gross. -The bathroom/shower was small and stuffy with no fans or windows. -The AC [[fan]]. I woke up so many times throughout the night because [[it]] was so hot, not to mention, IT WAS LOUD.  -They [[make]] you $10 for resort fee PER NIGHT plus tax or [[some]] [[so]] they [[charge]] because my CC came back and it was $11.30 per night. -[[quite]] much of a resort. Our apt complex's pool was about the same size. I didn't bother going, but I could see it from our room. It was sad. I paid $22 for NOT using their crummy "resort". Nope, you can't opt out.  -$5 parking fee. You can get that back at the front desk when you check in, and they'll give you a parking permit.

For our first [[time]] to Golden Dragon we met some friends here for [[food]] who recommended it.  We walked in and [[it]] [[feels]] as if I were in a time warp, [[only]] to the Brooklyn Chinese restaurants of my [[time]].  [[apparently]], not my youth youth, since a morsel of Chinese cuisine [[suddenly]] touched my lips until [[it]] was 12.  Every other Brooklyn Jewish family in the golden days of Brooklyn (oh, I [[wish]] that now Brooklyn is trendy, so it's [[somebody]] else's golden days),  "[[says]] Chinese" on Sunday.  It was [[a]] Law.  [[plus]] my family was Kosher, even at home.  [[save]] Chinese food on paper plates for [[it]].  [[and]] I was a rebel, so the first chance [[it]] [[struck]], at my friend Regina's sophisticated Birthday Dinner Party, I [[consumed]] the forbidden fruit.  [[mother]] [[family]] promised not to tell mine, though she'd [[notified]] her that she'd provide Kosher salami for me.  Yeah, [[maybe]].  Nothing [[without]] feeling different from your peers when you're 12.  [[or]] it was [[okay]].  And I was hooked.  But in those days, [[eastern]], pre-Szechuan, pre-Mongolian, there was only Cantonese.  And that's pretty much what Golden Dragon is all about.  I can't say that my sophisticated palate still loves the blandness of that cuisine, but what we ordered was mostly very good.  Not so much the Hot and Sour Soup because, after all, that's not Cantonese.    Even though our dinner was fairly recent, I can't remember what else we ordered, except for some spare ribs and an excellent Egg Foo Young for appetizers, and we sampled our friends' very tasty walnut shrimp, but everything was pretty yummy and well-prepared.  The service was terrific.  What bumps my rating from three to four stars is the value.  Where else can you get a 40 course dinner - if that's what you want - for $10.50?  Anything or everything on the menu, as long as you finish what you order.  No doggy bags.  None.  But clean your plate!!!  Oh, and they've raised the price a bit, since they now charge $1pp for tea.  But it was very good tea.

Harlan Banks is thief at the top of his game, but, after a successful career, he has decided to settle down with his woman and retire. However, he decides to take one last routine job in Las Vegas. All he has to do is drive the car and it seems simple. Unfortunately someone tips the police and after a hectic car chase he winds up in the slam only to escape and take revenge on those who betrayed and got him there in the first place. A typical action-fest ensues.  Steven Seagal plays himself (surprise!) wearing a trench-coat and sporting his beloved Colt 1911 along with his usual bone-breaking aikido. The Colt and aikido have always been with him, but the first I recall him with the trench-coat is in 'The Foreigner.' It isn't particularly impressive, but it does add a little notch to Seagal's lethal arsenal of badassness. Or it covers up those extra pounds he is packing. Look at it however way you choose. His main buddy throughout the film is played by Treach (another new thing, a rapper in an action movie) and they both [[unveils]] a little conspiracy of bad-guys, on both sides of the law, and give each evil-doer his due.  The film's main problem is that is it painfully, and I truly mean painfully, unoriginal. Seagal just follows a clockwork plot throughout the movie and even that manages to get more and more dull as the film progresses. Then it goes from dull to utterly ridiculous in the final scene as people who seemed to be dead on killing each other suddenly, for no reason, start to talk. Groan inducing in every sense of the word. The only real positive thing here is the decent opening - a car chase in Las Vegas complete with flipping police cars and generally entertaining mayhem, but after that brief highlight you've seen it all before. 3/10  Rated R: constant violence and profanity

The year 2004 was the year of the biopic with no [[basest]] than four pictures tackling real events, real people, with varying degrees of critical praise. Of the four pictures to make it to the race to the Oscars in early 2005 (KINSEY, THE AVIATOR, HOTEL RWANDA, and, RAY), RAY became the big winner of the night as the acting award went to Jamie Foxx for his portrayal of R & B genius Ray Charles.  And it was well-deserved despite that Leonardo diCaprio came close and Liam Neeson wasn't even nominated. What made Foxx the winner was that the other two were playing relatively obscure eccentrics, Ray Charles was still making music right up until his death in 2004 and by then there wasn't a soul who didn't know at least one song that Charles' had penned. It did help that Jamie Foxx rose well above the movie -- itself as a whole somewhat weak and often looking like it wouldn't be out of place as a TV biopic -- and his portrayal is detailed as it's [[sharp]]. He has the delicate assignment which is to embody a person down to nuances, and once the crisis of Ray's addiction to heroin hits a head, Foxx pulls out all the stops and it isn't hard to imagine the real Ray actually going through such a painful ordeal.  The low point of the film is how it spends a little too much time in detailing Ray's relationship with women. Like THE AVIATOR, Taylor Hackford wishes to establish that Ray had this turbulent life, a product of his own demons and his entry into success at a time when being black and successful brought a huge amount of baggage. Of the women, the only one to succeed bringing real life is Sharen Warren as Ray's mother. Hers is a difficult role since she is alone on screen with the child actor playing young Ray but her facial and body language is gut-wrenching, especially at the moment she must relinquish her maternity to have Ray find his way around the house. Such intensity of emotion, to stand there and watch your blind son crawl across a room and having to force him to have this rude awakening into independence. A beautiful performance, and one which should have been acknowledged.  A fantastic counterpoint to RAY is the featured music. Anyone who knows R & B will enjoy the early recordings of Ray's radio hits as much as his later ones which would bring him to the forefront of popular music, and Jamie Foxx virtually steals the show as he performs the songs as Ray. That alone will live on even when the movie in itself is little more than a stiff biopic. I would have, though, loved it if they would have used his last Adult Contemporary hit from 1993, "Sing my Song for You" in the closing credits. After all, it is Ray Charles, a performer who had a fierce dedication to his art.

We went this afternoon for a late breakfast. I've heard a lot about this place so we decided to do the drive up to North Phoenix.   We walked in and the whole "Man vs Food" situation was posted everywhere.  We decided to order the claim to fame giant king cavalier torta and ordered to split.  I ordered an agua de piña and it was great and when we asked for chips and salsa the server let us know they only had potato chips and no tortilla chips.............. (weird)........ Ok- so no chips LOL.  Our torta arrived and it was HUGE!!! So I'm all excited about this giant Mexican sandwich but then I realized that I'm not going to be able to bite into it because it's so huge (that's what she said- I know) ok so I split the sandwich in half to only have one top portion half to start ingesting.  There is every animal inside of this thing. Literally.  Ham, pork chop, hot dog, shredded chicken, carne Asada, and fried chicken, and chicken fried steak ( I think?) ok so [[loves]] the top half started out good but then I got grossed out with all the meat and then took off the fried chicken an chicken fried steak.  Then I threw off the hot dogs.  Then I just decided I was done once my boyfriend voiced that there was NO FLAVOR in the sandwich.  I was disgusted and just left it.  I honestly thought I was going to vomit on the way home because I just ingested who knows how many calories and didn't even find joy in it.  Oh- and our bill was $38.00 (the sandwich is $20 alone plus I got the agua de piña and Travis got a sprite.  We tried it at least? Bleh.
Okay I just want to say it is a [[marvelous]] place, really it is. The Interior design here is great and it was cool to see, [[THOUGH]] this place was FAR to crowed, I mean it was crazy.     The place was divided up into a bunch of small rooms with a bar, each had unique decor and different music playing which was pretty cool.  It operates on 3 levels, the main floor which is chill and has the restaurant, the second level which has the stage and other smaller rooms and upstairs where TAO beach (TAO Beach was better) is on the roof.      We went to see Public Enemy and the downside was that the entire place is all about VIP seating and booths and if you aren't VIP you are constantly shuffled around like a farm animal AND if you paid to see a show on a tiny stage, you wont see it very easily because the only standing room is the line to the bar and back out, unless you pay for a place to sit where you can view the stage. Also as others have pointed out the people there don't really seem to care about the music they came to see either....just a brainless crowd that acts stupid.   The drinks are way overpriced and small for what you end up with.  I was in heals and not being able to sit down really pissed me off (just sayin).  It was one of those annoying stand in one of 2 million long lines to get in while everyone acts self important scenes, just to get into an over [[cluttered]] and overpriced bar with no place to sit.  Overall it was an experience and I can appreciate the good points of it.  LIke seeing what we did of Public Enemy was pretty freakin cool even if the bouncers were constantly telling us we couldn't just stand there and watch the show we paid to see LOL.

The only conceivable flaw of this film is it's title!! Please stop comparing it to the first! I did in my previous review only to separate it from the first. If you haven't seen the movie and are curious, TOTALLY forget about the first and invent a different name for this. There is nothing alike and has a mood all its own. This is a great exponent of screwy mid-80s [[travesty]]. I seriously doubt such big names in this cast did the movie because they were broke or even wanted to remake the first. Anybody who ever wanted to give a kick to the snobbish aristocracy should love this little opus. I maintain, the only reason this is in the IMDB bottom 100 is because of its title. I usually hate movies like these (i.e. adam sandler, will farrell, farrelly bros....), but this movie just keeps me laughing hysterically. I dunno, maybe it's like a bad relationship I can't get out of or just a ridiculous guilty pleasure. Either way, this is the single most [[devalued]] movie of the 80s behind 'The Stunt Man.'  Robert Stack- WE LOVE YOU!!! (1919-2003)
We also found this movie on the discount rack and made the mistake of purchasing it because Sandra Bullock was featured on the cover. The cinematography was terrible and the back of the DVD box told more about the plot than the movie itself. Oh and I love the Uzi cam....[[NOS]].

[[Dearest]] the location especially when the ice skating rink is up and running. Sitting on the patio is pretty chill watching all the people happily skating around. Every time I have come for happy hour drinks with or without snacks, there is some kind of hassle ordering-- can't find wine, or glasses or how to ring it up on cash register, but I keep coming back because it is  a relaxing place to hang out without a ton of creeps--- it is what is is and for the most part it is just fine.

"East Side Story" is a documentary of musical [[comedians]] in Stalinist Russia and later in the eastern European satellite comedies, with many clips from the films and commentary from the survivors. [[that]] some of the Stalinist films look laughingly bad (The Bright Road (?) being a notable exception), the films from the sixties actually look pretty good. "My Wife Wants to Sing," "The White Mouse," and "Midnight Revue" look particularly entertaining. The producers had to contend with the censors, who had the power to decide what was politically correct, which led to some confusion, humorous in [[mind]], since the people whom the censors were trying to appease were the very people who supported making the films to begin with! [[because]] musical comedies were fairly rare behind the Iron [[can]] were only something like forty made in forty [[months]] had a disproportionate effect upon their audiences, who [[had]] major hits of some of the films.  [[me]] notice that the sound for the sixties films was much better. The directors often had to make do with antiquated equipment, and stringent power regulations--they had to film in seven minute takes or [[even]] dangerous officicrats.  I [[however]] [[see]] that "West Side Story" seems to have had a strong influence on "Hot Summer." The later films may not measure up to "Singin' in the Rain," but they certainly look like they beat the hell out of "Bye Bye Birdy"

I'm not sure whether i like this film or not. I think it is creepy and completely [[insane]].Crispin Glover as always gave a great performance as Layne. I think his performance was really good and one of his best, but i don't like the character at all. Keanu Reeves performance was really good, and i truly felt for his character. Over all i think the whole cast gave [[much]] [[performance]] as felt like the characters were real. [[it]] disliked some, but genuinely felt sorry for others (Keanu Reeves). I would like to know if that was the original ending that the film was supposed to have as it didn't end how i expected it to. I was disappointed in the ending and i don't feel that it did the rest of the film justice. If you are into creepy, weird and really well different movies, go for this one.

I just [[fulfilled]] watching Dog Watch. I thought parts of the movie were hokey with more than a few implausibilities. The acting wasn't too bad and the plot wasn't bad. BUT, as the saying goes, the devil was in the details.  Some examples:  1) The bleed-through on Charlie Falon's (Sam Elliott) bandage was shown to be coming from the back of his hand while it was his knuckles that were bleeding.  2) Would a detective dispose of his murder victim from a very well-lighted area? This seemed very silly to me.  I am not unusually picky about a movie but, in my humble opinion, this one is definitely [[EITHER]] recommended by me.
While [[my]] agree that this was the most horrendous movie ever made, I am proud to say I own a copy simply because myself and a bunch of my friends were extras (mostly in the dance club scenes, but a few others as well. This movie had potential with Bolo and the director of Enter the Dragon signed on, but as someone who was on set most every day I can tell you that Robert Clouse was an old and confused individual, at least during the making of this movie. It was a wonder he could find his way to the set everyday. I would also like to think that this might have been a better movie if a lot of it had not been destroyed in a fire at Morning Calm studios. I can't say that it would have been for sure, but it would be nice to think so. I was actually surprised that it was ever [[made]], and that someone like Bolo would attach his name to it without a fight. Oh well. Also [[arrive]] at the extras for pro wrestler Scott Levy, AKA Raven. He was a wrestler in Portland at the time...nice [[stuff]], very smart.

[[Forever]] coming here again found [[hairdos]] in my to go food
This place is absolutely [[beautiful]], for many reasons.    First and foremost, the food.  I ordered two large pizzas to [[accompany]] (cheese and vegetarian).  [[neither]] were absolutely delicious!  The crust is thin and light, the cheese melts in your mouth, the sauce ultra flavorful, and the veggies were fresh and cooked to perfection.  It was a definite hit with everyone.  The location is a bit hidden (it's in an industrial neighborhood), but still very convenient as it is right across the street from Tempe Marketplace.  The interior was charming, with brick walls and small tables - reminescint of what I envision a [[complete]] pizza parlor in Italy to look and feel like.  [[because]] the prices are higher than you would [[bet]] at a Dominos or Pizza Hut, so is the quality of the food - therefore, worth the extra few bucks.  Finally, the staff was amazing.  I had approached the manager for a [[potential]] food donation for a local charity, and he went above and [[below]] to provide us with ample food for all involved and made our charity experience that much more memorable.  Overall, this place is [[hardly]] worth a stop (or two, or three)!

I generally won't review movies I haven't seen in awhile, so I'll pop them in or rent them to give a full and fresh take on the film. In the case of 'A Sound of Thunder,' I remembered my vow of never seeing this movie ever again, so I'll just go on memory. In fact, I haven't thought of how [[spectacularly]] made this movie was until I read someone else's review and remembered the experience I had back in 2005, when I actually saw this in the theater. My movie buddy forced me to see it, though I wasn't interested, and wow. (Later on, I forced him to see 'Basic Instinct 2' in the theater, reminding him he made me see this [[baloney]]. So, I guess that made us even.) I certainly had my share of deep laughs (at the movie's expense, of course,) which didn't make him happy as he really wanted to see it. The time-travel/butterfly effect film had so many bad graphics, the loudest chuckles from me was whenever they showed the dinosaur (God, I loved seeing that dino and them actually being scared of it   it was hilarious!) or just simply, Ben Kingsley. It's great, Kingsley can remind us on how human actors can be: going from 'Gandhi' and 'Schindler's List' to, uh, this. (Even a Meryl Streep can do a 'She-Devil' from time to time, so they're forgiven.) For months, I pulled an MST3k with my buddy, consistently referencing this movie to any low-rent sci-fi film or Kingsley flick. Yes, the movie would be a great movie to see drunk (or otherwise inebriated): horrible over-the-top acting, "special" FX that even the Nintendo64 would turn away and ridiculous plot twists. The biggest disappointment was that the Razzies didn't even nominate this film for any award.

I never heard of architect, [[Luisa]] Kahn, until this documentary. In this almost two [[clock]] [[paperwork]] which goes very quickly, his son, Nathaniel Kahn, explores his father's [[existence]] from Estonia to the slums of North [[Philly]] to the University of Pennsylvania in West Philadelphia where he studied and taught. He travels to Bangladesh, Israel, Connecticut, [[Roanoke]], and La Jolla, [[Pasadena]] as well as New York City to explore his father's [[fanciful]] genius. Personally, [[Louise]] Kahn [[owns]] [[two]] families including his wife, Esther, who refused to [[provides]] him a [[mari]] and their [[consort]] Sue [[Amy]].

I went to see this film because it was recommended to my wife and she wanted to go.  We were both [[enticing]] to look at our watches well before the film ended, in order to see how much more we had to endure. Two hours and six minutes long, it is. It's divided roughly equally between battle scenes (about a dozen of them, all more or less interchangeable), and plot development.  One would have thought that with the subject being the son of a minor tribal chief who conquers half the world, [[conspired]] would have been relatively easy. There's a fair bit of raw material there from which to make a pretty good story. [[Even]] the writers fluffed it [[radically]]. We get no real history. We get instead a Hollywood version of history.  What sustains young Temudjin through his long -- almost endless, actually, or so they seem to the viewer -- tribulations? Why, the love of a good woman, of course.  How does he get out of prison? Well, an old monk, who recognizes his innate goodness and greatness, sets out across the continent to take to this good woman a talisman that symbolises Temudjin's love for her, dropping dead just close enough to her for her to find him as he lies there, talisman in his hand. And of course she then goes and, having (inexplicably) become rich and powerful, rescues him.  How does he escape from the shackles? Well, he goes off to the shrine of the great wolf-god Tengri (or some such name) and Tengri sets him free by magic. Yeah, right.  Why does he want to become ruler of the Mongols? The wolf-god again, apparently. Off goes Temudjin to ask for guidance, and -- surprise! surprise! -- he gets it. "Laws," he says to himself. "What the Mongols need are laws. Good, simple ones." Golly, it was impressive.  And then finally, how does he win the decisive battle against his rival's more powerful forces? Better tactics, certainly, but also through the aid of the good old wolf-god again, who sends a storm at the height of the battle. All the troops cower as the thunder rolls and the lightning flashes (Mongols are scared of thunder, you see) -- but not our Temudjin. The troops, completely wowed by his bravery, acclaim him king!   I don't know what induces people to keep producing this kind of garbage. The funny thing is it's interspersed with all sorts of gritty realism: lots of slurping of milk, dirt and violence. It's as if the producers of this movie wanted to get the trivial things right so that viewers wouldn't notice how infantile some of the big stuff is.  There's heaps of violence in graphic close-up: slashings, impalings, spouts of blood, sprays of blood, clouds of blood -- the blood guys had a great time, actually. Despite the realism, it's impossible to take seriously.  I must mention the ludicrous CGI final battle scene. How anyone can think these things look realistic is beyond me. They don't. Oh, and it's all shot in the standard Hollywood style -- breathtaking panoramas for the spectacular scenery, and the super-close-up Stedicam stuff for the battle scenes. And the standard Dolby super-sound-effects of whumps and thumps and the constant low-frequency hum to sustain tension.  Tedious.  Avoid.

I am currently watching this movie and I have absolutely no hesitation in reviewing it now. The acting is [[ridicule]]. Half the cast must be retired porno actors, and to get kicked off pornos you could imagine the quality of acting.  The graphics are unlike anything I have ever seen. I think there are puppet shows with more believability. They can't even afford blanks for the guns they shoot at the pathetic excuse for monsters. Perhaps I should also note how incredibly impressed I am at the number of 'bullets' their pistols can hold.   If asked to summarise the movie, I would say that someone had rustled up a group of complete no-hopers at the local county-fair, slapped them on an island, added needlessly intense music and let a 6 year old do the editing.  I can honestly not formulate any possible explanation for why this movie was released, recorded on DVD and costs $6 from my local video store for one day. If anything I have received the benefit of knowing that I am a lot smarter than all parties involved in this film.  I [[rancour]] this movie with great intensity. Why? I wish I knew Captain, I wish I knew....

Despite the complete absence of originality, this low-budget thriller manages to come up with some decent special effects and has several good performances (particularly by Robin Evans, oozing campy viciousness as the leader of the girls). The script isn't razor sharp, but it has enough quirks to make the proceedings [[abundantly]] bearable. ** from ****

The film starts out with a narration of the protagonist explaining certain crimes occurring all over the city and then we get to know that the hero is a [[gendarmerie]] who is either suspended or has probably retired.

As an English teacher, [[me]] appreciate films that do more than tell a story. Good films, like good literature, cause one to think, reflect and predict. This [[scorsese]] made me do all three. Mr. [[Devries]] [[opted]] risks and uses foreshadowing, symbolism and interesting turning points for many of his characters. I also [[cared]] the fact that despite the [[electing]] the [[idiosyncrasies]] make in the film, their choices do not seem as adolescent or felonious as other films I have seen. The acting is pretty good and the actors seem to share a good chemistry with each other. [[Sumptuous]] soundtrack, with songs you don't hear on the radio. It is a reconciling with life/spontaneous road trip film that deserves more than just a second glance.

After living in central Phoenix for almost 30 years I just moved 2 weeks ago to Paradise Valley. After hearing so many positive comments I decided to check it out with a friend.   Their website is impressive, it's in a high-end shopping area, and it appears they advertise as being the ultimate luxury movie experience. AND their website said they were showing one of my favorite classic comedies "The Philadelphia Story"! I was very [[pleased]].  I paid $48 for 2 tickets since the Premium Plus Seating looked incredible.  Walking in the theater is very impressive with the conceige desk-style ticketing and the bar and restaurant on either side. Very nice. I had purchased our tickets online and since both people at the counter were with other customers I went to the electronic kiosk and swiped my credit card. Here's where the problems [[appear]] that I will bulletpoint out below. Plus I will contrast and [[comparison]] my IPic experience with my history at AMC [[plaza]], supposedly IPic's poor cousin.  1) Visual experience entering the [[theatres]] and "fancy level"....ADVANTAGE: [[ci]]  2) Cost of highest level of seating...$24 per person at iPic, $[[51]].[[44]] at AMC. ADVANTAGE: AMC    2) The kiosk read that my tickets were printed but no tickets were printed. I waited at the counter and it took the young lady a few minutes to undertand what I was telling her had happened. She finally found our tickets and while handing them to me said "That kiosk is broken. I need to put a sign on it."  (I have never experienced a broken kiosk in the dozens of times I have visited AMC Esplanade. Getting your tickets purchased online from the ticket desk takes seconds.) ADVANTAGE: AMC    3) We get to our $48 movie theater seats and discover the chairs are not that wide and they do not recline very far because the row in front of you is very close. I am 6'1" and I was unable to recline my cloth-covered seat very far as my feet would have been on top of the guy's head sitting in front of me. (The Cinema Suits seats at AMC Explanade have a wide aisle in front and behind each row and the people in front and behind you are a complete level above and behind you. The AMC chairs are fake leather, wider than IPic, and recline almost complete flat.) ADVANTAGE: AMC    4) During our film, the music and sound effects of the movie in the theater on one side of ours was booming and thumping on and off repeatedly during our film. It was extremely distracting. (I have noticed the same thing at AMC Esplanade but not to that extreme level). ADVANTAGE: AMC    5) I went to the Men's room during the film. Nice restroom like in a fancier restaurant. The stall had a cool frosted glass door. Unfortuately, there was a huge wad of used TP next to the toilet and the paper seat covers had all been pulled out and halfway shoved back in. When I went to the restroom at the end of the film the stall was in the same condition. Also, for what is supposed to be a north Scottsdale upscale movie theater experience, why can't iPic give its customers better than the gauze-like half a ply TP they use? (The iPic restroom was much fancier than AMC Esplanade's but AMC keeps their restrooms much cleaner on a continual basis). ADVANTAGE: AMC  6) Our popcorn was served in tiny paper sacks. It had no taste like it was air popped. Tasteless popcorn in a small paper bag. Wow....how upscale. (AMC Esplanade has great popcorn that they serve in large bowls). ADVANTAGE: AMC  7) I asked for a Coke Zero and was told they only carried Coke and Diet Coke. You don't carry one of the best selling sodas in the world? My Diet Coke came in a cheap plastic takeout cup. (AMC Esplanade has Coke Zero and serves it in a real glass). ADVANTAGE: AMC  8) When our movie ended the DVD menu for the film immediately popped up. We commented on how it seemed a little strange and laughed about wondering if they had secured the rights for a public viewing of the DVD. It felt a little weird.  9) Theater location for iPic is in the swanky and beautiful Scottsdale Quarter. (AMC Esplanade is in the struggling Esplanade but across the street from the Biltmore Shopping Center. ADVANTAGE: iPic but only barely.  10) iPic parking garage is about a block away. (AMC Esplanade has an elevator and stairs that take you just feet from the theater doors). If you're lazy ADVANTAGE: AMC  The overall parts of our iPic experience seemed extremely incongruous to the luxury moviegoing experience that iPic advertises. It was a hugely disappointing experience and felt like a complete waste of $48. I wish I had asked for my money back. I will never visit iPic again and will instead go back to AMC Esplanade in the future.

I've read a lot of reviews about Showtime on IMDb and many seem to miss the mark. I've noticed a lot of reviewers calling this the typical "buddy" film. De Niro is in no way Murphy's buddy throughout most of this movie. In fact, part of the [[comical]] of this film is De Niro's reluctance to be friends with anybody.  Murphy really [[glisten]] in this one. He is back at doing what he does best, acting like a complete ham. He is a cop who wants so much to be an actor and enjoys being in the reality show. De Niro is perfect as the straight man who thinks the entire thing is stupid. I thought the two of them had great chemistry and were a perfect casting choice. Rene Russo is also great as the TV producer. Of course, she loves everything Murphy does and tries so hard (along with Murhpy) to get DeNiro going too.  A lot of reviewers have touched on the hilarious scene with William Shatner, reprising his role as TJ Hooker to train Murhpy & De Niro how to "act" like cops. But, my favorite scene involves Murphy in the "confessional" hoping he could get a Wesly Snipes-Like cop to team up with instead of De Niro. Man, that was hilarious! Comedies often depend on your personal tastes. Sure you could poke holes in the plot, most often you can with a comedy. I was psyched to see the pairing of Murphy and De Niro...I think it brought out the best in Murphy, which was nice to see him at the top of his game again. I can only imagine it was a great honor for Murphy to be paired with the great De Niro. Rating 8 of 10 stars.

[[with]] a positive experience with Dr. Davis and his office, I brought my expensive Calvin Klein sunglasses in to get a new set of lenses. When I got them back, the lenses didn't seem right. I asked the optician to look at them and she did something with the right arm and she broke it! Her attitude was, you signed a release and your screwed! We're not responsible even though the glasses broke when she was working with them. I was very upset with the lack of s caring attitude and hiding behind a release form. I am [[relieved]] with the opinion that once they get their money from VSP, game over. I had to take my broken sunglasses to a frame repair place and pay $65 cash to get them fixed. VSP did reimburse the $[[6]] to me because they do care about their [[users]], unlike Dr. Davis and his staff. The take away from this experience is that Dr. Davis is a good eye doctor but his business practices leave a bit to be desired! Definitely do not use his office to get new lenses on your exiting frames. He will not stand by them if anything happens! Unfortunately in today's world, good customer service is [[easy]] to find. It's all about the $$$ and not the customer.

Pilot [[Tameca]] MacAfee (Jeff [[Stancil]]) sees a UFO while test flying a plane--but nothing shows up on radar. Then planes and ships start disappearing and reports of a UFO increase. It turns out it's a giant monster bird that is attacking and killing. But what is it and why is it here?   This has all the right elements for a classic. It has an actually pretty entertaining script--I was never really bored. The acting is good (for a 1950s monster movie). Morrow doesn't overdo the macho hero act and Mara Corday is quite good as the requisite female love interest. [[Brecken]] also strong and takes care of herself--even though she IS off getting food and coffee for everyone all during the movie. The problem here is the monster. Dear God--it's TERRIBLE! It looks like a deranged turkey! It has a long neck, a hilariously stupid BEAK, some teeth, a few strands of hair on its head and claws. And--oh yes--it squawks! Not roaring--squawking! The actors had no idea what it looked like--it was added after production. Actors Morrow and Corday were horrified when they finally saw it in a theatre. Morrow said his audience burst out laughing and he left the theatre quickly before the movie ended! Producer Sam Katzman was responsible for this. He wanted to save money and gave the world the stupidest monster ever. And you can SEE the wires moving it too! This gets 4 stars only because Morrow and Corday are so good and the script is well done. It gets no stars for the pathetic monster--wait till you see it attack what is obviously a toy train! Worth a look if you're a horror fan to see what has to be the stupidest monster ever.

I [[commemorate]] [[admiring]] this mini-series the first time in 1984 with a growing sense of anger and indignation. Having read the comments on this title, I must agree with those from the people in Greece. This was produced to coincide with the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games and, to me, it seemed like nothing more than an [[maneuvers]] in jingoistic, flag-waving American nationalism in which the American athletes are glorified at everyone else's expense. Some other nationalities would have every right to feel deeply insulted at the way they were portrayed in this series. It may, however, help to explain the way in which many American spectators behaved at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics and the TV coverage which seemed only interested in events that Americans were likely to win.

This movie is [[horrific]]. It creates characters not in the book, and some of them are ethnic or racial stereotypes. Including an obnoxious little Jewish boy and a politically correct little black girl. Not to mention the Yiddish speaking [[goblins]]. The book was a simple story about belief, and this movie is a dark, [[nasty]], and needlessly scary movie about nothing.  The animation is superb, but the story has been ruined by Hollywood.  The good thing is that this movie will take a bath in the box office and maybe producers will learn to keep from tampering with a story that needs no improvement. Hanks was overdone and i don't see why there couldn't have been other actors' voices be used.

Victor Sjöström was quite the master in this film, having starred in it, directed it and even wrote the screenplay! That's pretty amazing. While today few have any idea who Sjöström was, he might be familiar to Ingmar Bergman fans as the star one of Bergman's most acclaimed films, WILD STRAWBERRIES.  As far as this film goes, it's a very mixed bag. On one hand, you have to respect it because for 1921, it's a very [[bonne]] film. The idea of the Grim Reaper sitting down with a dead man to discuss his wasted life is pretty imaginative. Plus, the special effect of the Phantom Carriage is pretty convincing and technically speaking this is a well-crafted film. On the other hand, it's an amazingly dated and preachy film--more like something you'd expect to be shown in Sunday School instead of in an honest to goodness theater. Plus, some of the story elements just don't make sense. Instead of coming off as dedicated or good, the dying Salvation Army worker seems like a sap--a very sad and confusing sap. Why is she "in love" with this man? Am I missing something?  So, my recommendation is that if you are insanely in love with silents (like me), then by all means watch it. But, if you aren't a silent fan, this film might do nothing to convince you that this style film is brilliant because the story is so overly melodramatic and dated.

The Hospital is a movie that was made ahead of its time. This film, produced by screenwriter Paddy Chayefsky, who gave us the Oscar-Winning film, "Network", deals with overworked staff, gross incompetence, and bureaucratic corruption at a large conglomerate hospital in Manhattan. George C. Scott, in a [[great]] performance as the head physician, is driven to alcoholism and a death-wish, as he tries to recover from a divorce, throwing his son out of the house, and worst of all, a medical facility where corruption and incompetence take precedence over caring and healing of the sick and injured.  Mr. Scott makes the movie his own, and viewers will be shocked at what they observe at this medical establishment. You can feel the "pain" (pun intended) of what this hospital has done to him. The vivid images of this [[hospital]] incompetence are so vivid and dramatically powerful that you may find yourself laughing and being deeply disturbed from scene to scene.  If only the film had stayed with that premise in a documentary style fashion as it starts out, this picture would be brilliant. Unfortunately, there is a sub-plot of Scott falling for the daughter of a senile patient. The patient has been murdering people at the hospital. This is where credibility of the picture becomes strained. The romantic dialog scenes add nothing to the picture, and the mental patient, posing as a doctor, I found to be totally unbelievable. A simple security call and records check should have prevented the senile patient from doing the killings. It takes almost the whole movie, before security people are brought into the film to get the patient out of the hospital. I could not see ONE PERSON doing that much damage, even as corrupt as this hospital is.  Furthermore, George C Scott's character is "overworked" (another pun intended) because the script has too many things happening at once. For example, within a period of 20 minutes, you could have as many as 20 different doctors accused and denying what they should have done or didn't do. With the nurses and aids, it's the same story. Someone's chart was read wrong, someone was given the wrong medication and died, the doctor operated on the wrong patient, than another doctor does the same thing, blaming a third nurse who was not on call because the second nurse who was supposed to be admitting the patient was on her coffee break. There is also a lot of subtle, dark humor with the same messages of incompetence and corruption being fed to the viewer.  This repetition of medical ineptness is unforgettable. However, the murder subplot is a distraction more than a help to this movie. When the focus of this film is on the incompetence of the staff and Scott's reactions to this, you are glued to the screen. But the conversations between Scott and the mad patient's daughter force the film into a mystery type "Who Done it?" scenario that seriously hurts the quality of the movie. When the loony patient is revealing how he did the killings, I wondered the following: Why did the producers need the "find the killer" mad-patient sub-plot? I think the only point of Scott's character having a relationship with the senile patient's daughter, was to give him anybody with whom to communicate. The Hospital should have maintained its scathing indictment of the medical profession by removing the love-interest and mad patient scenes. It should have focused on the incompetent B.S within its walls more frequently. In an era where this movie could have been phenomenal, the sub-plot stories make the film very good instead of the great masterpiece it could have been.

A year after the release of the average "House of Frankenstein", Universal released another Monster Mash where all their famous character would collide once again. "House of Dracula" would reunite Dracula, the Frankenstein's creature and the Wolf Man for what would be their final battle and will finally close an era for the studio. Directed once again by Erle C. Kenton, "House of Dracula" presents a slight but noticeable improvement over the previous film and delivers a better constructed (although still flawed) story that while far from [[exemplary]], is a more appropriate closure than the previous film.  The story ignores most of the events of the previous entry, "House of Frankenstein", and introduces a new angle to the story. Count Dracula (John Carradine), tired of having to hide during sunlight, asks help to the brilliant scientist, Dr. Edelman (Onslow Stevens), a physician famous for his research in biology. Edelman becomes fascinated by Dracula, and soon begins an experimental treatment, in the mean time, Larry Talbot (Lon Chaney Jr.), the Wolf Man, visits Edelman with the purpose of get rid of his curse. Soon Edelman realizes that Dracula is a monster that must be destroyed, but his own exposure to Dracula's blood is also developing a disease in him. The discovery of the Frankenstein's monster (Glenn Strange) in a nearby catacombs will bring more turmoil to the mind of the brilliant scientist.  After the previous clash of monsters, it is good to see the series going back to the roots and delivering an almost straight-forward Gothic horror returning to the dark pessimistic nature of this kind of films and moving away from the comic relief of the previous entries. The story (by Edward T. Lowe Jr.), has many interesting themes, as the contrast between Dracula and Talbot (both looking for a cure, but with different purposes) and Edelman's increasing madness. Probably among the most interesting themes is the inclusion of the character of Nina, a gorgeous but deformed woman who aids Dr. Edelman hoping to be cured of her condition.  Director Erle C. Kenton is back again and this time he finally captures the dark nature of these three characters, a nature that was apparently lost in the previous film. Despite the low-budget, Kenton crafts a Gothic horror that while simple, is quite effective, and even manages to present old partners such a these characters in a fresh way. While it's never on the level of the originals, "House of Dracula" recovers that charm that Universal Studios horror films used to have, and Kenton makes sure that at least for a last time the monsters receive a chance to shine.  The cast is very good this time, with Carradine, Chaney and Strange reprising their roles (although Strange's role is considerably smaller) with more enthusiasm than in the previous film. The addition of Onslow Stevens, Jane Adams and Martha O'Driscoll to the cast bring back the tragedy and the drama to the series, with Stevens giving a terrific performance as Dr. Edelman. A small cameo by Lionel Atwill and the presence of Skelton Knaggs as the creepy Steinmuhl complete one of the better cast Universal horror films has had in years.  "House of Dracula" is a nice addition to the series, specially after the mediocre "House of Frankenstein". It's nice to see Kenton back in form in a somewhat serious horror film, however, and while the plot is quite original, it suffers not only because of the budget, but because the film attempts to do a lot in a very short runtime with bad results. It's true that the characters have all very inventive story lines, but the film dedicates very few time for each of them to develop, and the film seems very rushed and disjointed.  While far from perfect, it's also far from being the worst of the series. "House of Dracula" is a nice closure to one of the best times for the horror genre, a time when ghosts and ghouls roamed the foggy nights, and mad scientists gave life to hideous monsters. Later the monsters would be back in "Bud Abbott & Lou Costello Meet Frankenstein" (1948), but that would be a whole different context. after the disappointing previous entries, it's easy to dismiss "House of Dracula", but give it a chance, and let the monster roam for a last time. 7/10

It was very refreshing to watch this beautiful [[travesty]]. The director maintained focus on the main subject without venturing into side plots (the doctor's family or stories of the other hospital patients), that are so typical of Bollywood assembly-line products. He kept the narrative simple to comprehend and made sure all the actors are true to the characters that they are supposed to portray. The rustic ways of the grandfather in the clinic, the cold and unemotional behavior of the surgeon, the zeal of the social worker gave the movie a feel of genuineness. I am also glad that the director did not fall for the temptation of adding songs or special effects and reduce it to the level of Anand or Safar. A couple of scenes toward the end of the movie, such as the boy visiting other blind children and a blind worker's workplace and also the final scene where the boy claps at the sound of splashing and birds chirping are sure make your eyes misty.  Many Bollywood players do not realize that Oscar committee members value simplicity of the subject and genuineness and brevity of the movie more than the glitz and glamor. Shwaas is certainly a better nomination than Lagaan, which dealt with a subject that has already been beaten to death. No MPAA member is willingly going to suffer through 4 hours of jingoistic drama and a lot of song and dance.  I look forward to more movies from director Sandeep Sawant in the future.

Before hitting international acclaim with The Silence of the Lambs, director Jonathan Demme cut his teeth making quirky comedies. This was one of them and like quite a few Oscar winning American comedies I could mention, it has a fine concept, is well paced, has great performances, a complicated [[melodrama]]. but it just simply isn't very [[droll]]. Pfeiffer is mob widow who moves to the city backwaters after her husband (Baldwin) is murdered. The crime boss who killed him (Stockwell) takes a fancy to Pfeiffer, his wife (Reuhl) is furious and to complicate matters Pfeiffer also falls for the cop who is trailing her. All of this [[shall]] have been a laugh a minute. Pfeiffer, sporting a hefty wig is excellent as the [[widowers]], as is the hyperactive Ruehl and Modine is good too as the nice cop. [[Yet]] the script is simply [[free]] of one-liners, wit, humour or punch lines of the verbal or physical kind that this kind of film demands. The result is it raises smiles at best rather than guffaws. It oozes charm, but is tediously short on humour.

I had watched this as a kid but, not being much of a Jerry [[Woosley]] fan, I had completely forgotten it (not that it's in any way memorable). The film revolves around impersonation (which seems to be in the curriculum of every comic star!) - in this case a German officer - and, while not as bad as Leonard Maltin claims (awarding it a BOMB rating), it's not exactly classic stuff either - certainly leagues behind [[Sofie]] THE GREAT DICTATOR (1940), even if comparably narcissistic! Ironically, the scenes prior to the appearance of the would-be wacky General offer more felicities than the rather forced humor at Nazi expense!   The film was really Lewis' last gasp during his heyday; in fact, this proved to be his last vehicle to be released for 10 years (it's painfully apparent here that his particular brand of foolishness wouldn't pass muster in the age of Mel Brooks and Woody Allen)!

It's just that he's shy on the surface but analyses everything until he can learn something from it. The most [[sumptuous]] feature of the series are the circumstances surrounding his "education", which are outright embarrassing, yet funny at the same time.

This was just telecast here in the U.S. Others have commented on the faithfulness (or lack of same) to the novel; the 1983 BBC version is far superior on this and all other counts. Given the scope of the novel, it should not have been condensed to 85 minutes. Key sections have to be rushed or alluded to, or omitted; there barely enough time just to get in the chronology of events, so character development has to be sacrificed: we [[can]] get much of a sense of who the people are, which robs us of what makes Austen so great.  One major negative for me was the cinematography, which I thought was just [[wonderful]], and quite literally sickening. The camera is constantly doing ultra-closeups, and swirling around and around in circles. Maybe on a small TV box this is OK, but on our 40" hi-def screen it was so literally [[stunning]] that both my wife and I had to look away from the set repeatedly (my Dramamine supply had run out). Of course, this did distract from the rather [[excessive]] [[sound]] acting (isolated scenes are nicely done, but not enough to save things).  [[building]] up the score so far in the Complete J.A. Sweepstakes: I'd rate "Northanger Abbey" a success, because of superior direction and production values (and the story lends itself better to short treatment), "Persuasion" OK (though not the equal of other versions, with condensation again being at fault), both far ahead of this attempt. I will hope for better in the two remaining novels in this TV Reader's Digest Jane Austen; like others, I am thankful they left P & P alone!

I especially love their Gazpacho, Roasted Red Pepper Hummus and Spinach Cheese Lavosh thing on their app menu.

They were by no means the best doughnuts I had [[tasted]] before, a little doughier than I had expected but it [[only]] hit the spot. They hadn't skimped on the cream and it [[faded]] out of the doughnut with every bite and [[me]] was more than satisfied with my [[choices]]. I didn't [[mind]] the other doughnuts but all my [[sisters]] [[hoped]] was that it was okay as she [[gulped]] it down.   [[could]] I come back again? Sure, why not.

One of the [[other]] lesser known occult oriented horror movies of the seventies. It's gritty, exciting, scary, surrealistic here and there and at moments even very smart, which can't be said about many of the movies this kind. I can't help seeing some stinging symbolic and metaphoric points at the seventies society and generation stuff of the [[movie]] this movie was done. The scriptwriter has obviously been cooking while delivering also some good old "from the crypt" kind of scenes. With a job well done from a creative director the result is entertaining and thought provoking. The simple, yet effective ending specially [[is]] how these things are treated right by those who can.  The excellent cast were mostly unknown to me, except L. Q. Jones as the moody but funny sheriff and Strother Martin as the town doctor. Martin, not surprisingly, always ends up stealing the movie. With that voice and skill he is one of the greatest loonies in movies, for me anyway. What an actor!  So, it is a little bit of mystery to me why this movie has not gathered far greater recognition. I think it would deserve almost equal place in the occult horror canon alongside [[hell]] Baby and The Exorcist. [[pure]] helluva movie!

I've always been a fan of Jackass, as well as Viva La Bam and Wildboyz. And when you're a fan of something, your expectations are high to whatever your "heroes" might star in. And if there's one thing I've learned about expecting a lot from the people you simply love to watch and listen to, it's never to expect to much, 'cause in 99 out of a 100 times, you'll get disappointed.  Although, when I heard there was a Jackass 2 coming up, I thought "Not even I can turn down my expectations for this [[travesty]]", and as a result of that I sat down today, ready to laugh, but also ready to say in the end "Well, it was OK, but I'm a little disappointed". How wrong was I! Every single member of the Jackass crew brings this movie way over the first one, showing you the one crazy ass stunt after the other, making the whole world see that there's nothing they wont do to try to harm themselves - and that's what we love! I cried my eyes out laughing from the first minute and till the very last second of the movie, at some times even shouted in laughter, not able to control myselfuck Stunt after stunt, prank after prank, and hilarious comments on the flow - it can simply not get any better than this! Amazing from start till end, guaranteed to make you laugh your ass off. I've got two things left to say; WATCH IT, and PLEASE God, let there be a Jackass 3 - these guys clearly has a lot to offer!

Another [[theatres]] to [[punishments]] us for the crime of [[enjoy]] "Pulp Fiction."  If you like watching people get killed by machine gun fire for an hour and a half, this'll [[naturally]] [[wrap]] the bill. Fans of the debut [[episodes]] of "[[Eun]] Flux," wherein the title character [[died]] literally thousands of seemingly [[unfamiliar]] [[armies]] single-handedly, [[want]] really go for it.  Otherwise, it's not exactly a clever movie. In fact, all it is is an excuse for a bunch of young people to act rude and shoot people. Sometimes an entire scene goes by, and the only [[ding]] that happens is, you guessed it! someone gets shot. Or, to spice things up, twenty people get shot. First, they're just sitting there, the next minute, they're sitting there dead. Yahoo!  Rough plot: A young American goes to Paris (An American in Paris, get it?), hires a prostitute (the ethereal Julie Delpy), gets in touch with some old French buddies, one of which has AIDS, they plan and attempt a bank heist. Of course, movie convention states that no bank [[flight]] on film go off w/o a hitch, and this hitch takes up about three-quarters of the running time (it's like "Dog Day Afternoon" without the Sidney Lumet's wit, patience, or humanity). While at the bank, things go wrong (surprise!), and the Parisian with AIDS, goes wacko with his Uzi several HUNDRED times. No spoilers here, but suffice to say that you're at such an emotional distance from these characters that it's not likely you'll care who lives and who dies by the end of the film.  Some have called it stylish. Perhaps it is, but it's someone else's style, it's a movie that's already been done, and "Killing Zoe" is trapped by convention. Nowhere in the course of the movie does the director (Roger Avary, co-winner of the "Pulp Fiction" screenplay Oscar) do anything really original, stylish, funky, or outrageous. Unless you consider the fact that no movie that has taken place inside a bank has had such a high body count, there isn't anything else to set this one apart from the multitude.

I'm not sure whether i like this film or not. I think it is [[horrid]] and completely weird.Crispin Glover as always gave a great performance as Layne. I think his performance was really good and one of his best, but i don't like the character at all. Keanu Reeves performance was really good, and i truly felt for his character. Over all i think the whole cast gave great performances as felt like the characters were real. I disliked some, but genuinely felt sorry for others (Keanu Reeves). I would like to know if that was the original ending that the film was supposed to have as it didn't end how i expected it to. I was disappointed in the ending and i don't feel that it did the rest of the film justice. If you are into creepy, weird and really well different movies, go for this one. If you like things that are normal, please stay away.

Spoilers abound. You have been warned.  I was thoroughly [[impressed]], this being my first STREET FIGHTER movie I have seen (I dare not go near the 1994 joke yet). Very little grabs your attention in STREET FIGHTER ZERO (ALPHA) as opposed to most japanimation. The fights are hilariously done over board (Shun versus Zangief was a laugher) and the dramatization is far too moody especially toward the end when Ryu has to control everything in his fight against his brother.  The main street fighter, Ryu, has been weakening to a far darker version inside of himself. Frustrations in controlling this darkness are further complicated by the sudden arrival of a younger brother! A shady street fighting tournament is held with more than just fighting on the promoter 's mind.  What is with the artist 's drawing of feet? Any anime drawn above the stomach is impressive. The story 's soft nature makes the STREET FIGHTER genre far too intelligent, and places far more emphasis on a character (Shun), that is not even a fighter in the video game! A character study on more than just the core stars of the original STREET FIGHTER is completely ignored. How many times did you catch Rolento? Adon? Guy? STREET FIGHTER ZERO lacks the imagination of the video game.

"Edge of the City" is another movie that owes a lot of credit to "On the Waterfront". From it's NYC locations, to its score, to the belief that whatever trouble you may be in, you can somehow right your wrongs.  "Edge" also deals with ideas like loyalty and racism. In my opinion, that is where the movie does not succeed like "Waterfront". At 85 minutes the movie rushes through the establishment of relationships, and ties everything up so quickly that much of it [[looks]] forced and unbelievable.  Possible Spoilers****  The relationship between Sidney Poitier and John Cassavettes could have been further developed in the beginning. I don't believe that these two characters, from two very different places would have built such a strong relationship so quickly.   I think that the whole love sub-plot with Cassavettes could have been eliminated. He is so awkward with a woman that it becomes painful to watch. The only reason why it is in the movie is so that she can motivate him to do the right thing at the end. There are other ways that they could have shown this. I would have also liked to see some scenes of Axel in the army to illustrate why he is the way he is.  The acting is excellent. Poitier is terrific in a role that is beautifully written. His role as Tyler is interesting and multi-layered, and (especially for 1957), a man who is confident, respected, and intelligent. Cassavettes, as Axel North, while very good, does not seem quite right for the part. Warden is terrific as the boss who knows Axel's secret (although his fight scene with Cassavettes at the end is staged horribly. Too many break-away boxes). I thought Ruby Dee was wonderful in role of Poitier's wife.  On the whole, "Edge of the City" is a smart, movie with a very good cast that tries too hard to be an interesting noir style picture, without taking the time to let the drama build.  7 out of 10

There were at least a half dozen silent-film versions of Shakespeare's "The Merchant of Venice," and there have been several television productions. But no one has ever gotten around to making a big-budget theatrical feature from the play . . . until now. Given the nature of the [[travesty]]/s most memorable character, Shylock the Nasty Jew, it's a good guess that the little unpleasantness that transpired in Europe in the late 1930's and 1940's may have dampened filmmakers' enthusiasm. Sure the main motivation for Michael Radford's new film is to provide Al Pacino with a chance to shout, bray, brood, mutter, and be tormented - all of which he is quite good at. Like Richard III, the role of Shylock is a scenery-chewer's dream. It is ridiculous to call Shakespeare an anti-Semite, since he never met a Jew. Jews were banned from England from 300 years before his time to some decades after his death; and its unlikely that he ever traveled abroad. On some level, Jews might as well have been a mythological race to him. But, while Shakespeare may not have been anti-Semitic, his play certainly is. Pacino gives Shylock a strange accent that is probably meant to suggest the slightest hint of Yiddish. Unfortunately, the result is a 16th-century moneylender with the unmistakable diction and cadences of Fozzie Bear. Radford's version begins with a crawl about the wretched teratment of Jews and then spot Antonio (Jeremy Irons) gratuitiously spitting on Shylock (Pacino), who's really just standing around, minding his own business. Will buy it when it comes out on DVD, for sure! Sarge Booker

Would I like an upgrade - "we have a really nice BMW for you" - how much is that? An extra $99 per day on top of what I had paid - no thanks.  Well I can get you something more comfortable, or fun like a Jeep Wrangler.  NO thanks, I just want what I paid for.  How about an SUV - No thanks.  I just want the car I reserved (mid-size).  Well sorry - it will be a long wait - the ONLY car available (I was in a hurry) was the darned Wrangler (noisy POS that I totally did NOT want but she was determined to put me in) and then talked me into insurance before she would let me go - with taxes etc $85 for 28 hours.  Never again - I guess I'll book directly with Avis next time in Phoenix.  I never want to use Budget there again.  Thanks Angela
It's been a long time since such an [[initially]], quite funny, black comedy has surfaced. If "Eating Raoul" is on your top 100 list, do yourself a favor and find "Undertaking Betty" immediately. The subject of death being funny has been attempted before (see Paul Bartel and Mary Woronov in "Mortuary Academy"). [[Despite]] that movie has some brilliant moments of black comedy, "Undertaking Betty" is much more [[incessant]], with a better cast. Who could imagine that the undertaking business might be fertile ground for an original, uplifting, and heartfelt comedy? I was surprised and you will be too. I highly recommend seeing "Undertaking Betty" - MERK

Watchers is a fun movie if it's not taken too seriously, the novel written by Dean R. Koontz is obviously a lot better but the movie itself is entertaining in it's own way. The film has a lot of changes for the novel Watchers, the one difference is the main character Travis. In the book he was an adult and an retired Delta Force soldier while in the film he's a teenager. Watchers has it's good points, the film does have some gory scenes in parts. I'm a fan of Micheal Ironside and it was cool to see him in this film, he always does a great performance in all his films. The OXCOM costume looks kind of cheesy but the camera [[still]] really shows the creature fully until near the end of the film. The dog Einstien was impressive since it was well trained.  The film sees two genetic experiments escaping from a lab, a dog and a monster. Both experiments are linked telepathically since the two animals are part of a military project were the dog would infiltrate an enemy base then the Creature would attack and eliminate them. The Dog finds a teenager named Travis who takes him home and discovers that he's intelligent and so he names the dog Einstein, meanwhile the OXCOM is roaming around killing people and gouging out their eyes, two Government agents are sent to find the two experiments before this incident gets out of hand. Soon Travis learns that his not safe as the OXCOM is drawn to the dog and will stop at nothing to kill him and anyone in it's way, so Travis and his mom go to rescue his girlfriend who's being held at the hospital by the two agents. They then hideout in the woods while the Government agents and the OXCOM are not far behind.  Watchers is not a great adaptation of Dean R. Koontz novel but it is a entraining 80's horror flick, some fans of the book may not want to watch this since it's not faithful to the book but fans of cheesy 80's horror movies may want to check this out.

Airplane apart, I don't think I've ever laughed at a film so much in all my life.  I love football like mad, but I tend to hate almost any song or film about football as they tend to be unrealistic. This wasn't.  I watched it once, it was over 2 years ago & it was brilliant. Everyone [[you]] know loved it. I remember the gay physio, the sloping pitch at about a 45 degree angle and 'Shoes' (a player so named because he once turned up for training in a new pair of shoes). [[shit]], that's what goes on in park football.  A [[bit]] 10/10. If anyone from the TV industry is reading this, considering all the crap you repeat on English tele, please have the sense to show this again (and the Muppets while you're at it). Also does anyone know if this was shown on BBC or ITV. I think it was ITV, so it's worth asking them if they plan to show it again. They should do.
This was a [[gargantuan]] movie. It had one "sot-so-nice" outburst. Plus there were some very intense (drama) scenes which might make it [[misdirected]] for younger viewers, under 6.  For a under the radar film, the acting was quite enjoyable, and touched down in our family room for a near perfect landing. It held the attention of our whole family and we were kind of sorry to see it end.  This movie had elements of spy kids with young people saving the day, but was given a somewhat more believable scenario. The dream scenes were a distraction at first, but did a great deal to establish the plot. The pranks and hi-jinx were also quite amusing.  We hope you like as much as we did.

We went this afternoon for a late breakfast. I've heard a lot about this place so we decided to do the drive up to North Phoenix.   We walked in and the whole "Man vs Food" situation was posted everywhere.  We decided to order the claim to fame giant king cavalier torta and ordered to split.  I ordered an agua de piña and it was great and when we asked for chips and salsa the server let us know they only had [[cauliflower]] chips and no tortilla chips.............. (weird)........ Ok- so no chips LOL.  Our torta arrived and it was HUGE!!! So I'm all excited about this giant Mexican sandwich but then I realized that I'm not going to be able to bite into it because it's so huge (that's what she said- I know) ok so I split the sandwich in half to only have one top portion half to start ingesting.  There is every animal inside of this thing. Literally.  Ham, pork chop, hot dog, shredded chicken, carne Asada, and fried chicken, and chicken fried steak ( I think?) ok so like the top half started out good but then I got grossed out with all the meat and then took off the fried chicken an chicken fried steak.  Then I threw off the hot dogs.  Then I just decided I was done once my boyfriend voiced that there was NO FLAVOR in the sandwich.  I was disgusted and just left it.  I honestly thought I was going to vomit on the way home because I just ingested who knows how many calories and didn't even find joy in it.  Oh- and our bill was $38.00 (the sandwich is $20 alone plus I got the agua de piña and Travis got a sprite.  We tried it at least? Bleh.
i was disappointed in this documentary.i thought it would be about the second chess [[war]] between Grandmaster Garry [[hausen]] and Deep Blue the [[machine]] designed by IBM computer experts to beat any human chess player.Kasparov was and still is,considered the greatest chess player ever.the movie takes us back to 1997 where Kasporov had agreed to have a rematch with "deep Blue" after defeating it 1 year earlier.but instead of focusing on the game,it focuses more on what happens before and after.there are snippets of the [[episodes]],but not very many.much of the film centers around Kasporov's paranoid obsession that the match was rigged as part of some conspiracy theory and that he lost the match unfairly.the movie also [[brings]] interviews with people who are not interesting in any way.they even chat with the manager of the building where the match took place.who cares?i also found it very dry and [[fun]].[[also]] this movie was [[fun]].this is just my opinion,of course.if you like conspiracy theories,this movie [[must]] interest you.for people not into chess or conspiracy theories,this movie [[will]] probably have no [[surprises]].i am a chess [[man]],and i only stuck it out because of that.i give"Game Over:Kasparov and the Machine" 4/10

Yes, at times "Unconditional Love" overwhelms as it bounces -- no, as it ricochets -- from one story element to another in the most unconventional use of thematic elements and characters. In fact, it wasn't until I watched the [[travesty]] for the second time that I began to understand what I think P.J. Hogan might have been attempting to do with this quirky, unconventional flick. Perhaps the entire film itself is a metaphor for the unconditional love for which Grace (Kathy Bates) yearns and describes in the later part of the film. Grace insists that unconditional love is just that, without condition and without qualification. So I watched "Unconditional Love" again with that in mind. I laughed much more than I did the first time, I became more involved with the characters, I began to understand the, at times, absurd turns the story takes. The performances are often over the top but no more than they need to be to fit Hogan's weird and whacky vision, a vision which moved me to tears, yearning and outbursts of side-splitting laughter. Yes, Hogan is asking a great deal of his audience. But I for one have come to truly love his film -- unconditionally.

Roy Scheider is not [[Roberts]] McQueen or Clint Eastwood but then who is? The Seven-Ups is one of the better cop movies, even [[mondays]], and is second only to McQueen's [[Dingbat]] and the Dirty Harry series, which isn't bad company. There are three things that seem to make a good cop movie: [[Persuading]] script with [[considerable]] acting, great [[motor]] chase scenes, and some [[laborious]] action. [[That]] movie has all three and the [[vehicle]] chase [[filmmaking]] is better than that in Dirty Harry. Scheider plays the head of a [[pools]] of [[police]] out to [[come]] NY's [[lousy]] [[companions]] [[sentences]] to seven [[ages]] or more; hence the [[named]] Seven-Ups.

When a loser teen is bitten by an insect, he becomes the superhero Dragonfly...  Superhero Movie is the latest spoof movie to hit the screens. Sadly however, despite the presence of David Zucker (who was involved with Airplane!, Top Secret and The Naked Gun movies) it still suffers from the fault most recent spoofs have...mainly it's more [[clever]] than fun! The fault mainly lies with the gags. It's [[really]] not funny enough. Some of the jokes do work, such as the nail gun scene, but other parts simply fall flat. The X-men spoof for example, or the whole farting sequence. Blazing Saddles this isn't! One of the key things about the best spoof movies, like Airplane is that although the dialog is extremely funny, the cast for the most part play is completely straight. This makes it even [[laugh]]. Even when there is simple dialog in the foreground, there may well be funny things happening behind the cast. Again funny. The other key thing is that they all have a plot of sorts, to hang the gags on.  The recent trend seems to be to take scenes from various movies, THEN try and spoof them. As a result the so-called plot of these movies very rarely exist. Another flaw these movies have, is that some of the scenes were actually funny in the original versions, and in most cases even funnier than the spoof scene! The cast try to get into the spirit required, but with a lot of unfunny dialog and scenes, it's hard to get worked up about it.  As recent spoof movies go, it's not as bad as Epic Movie, Date Movie, or the awful Meet The Spartans, but considering that some people involved here have made good, funny movies in the past, it's nowhere near good enough.

My boyfriend and I were staying at a hotel about 5 minutes away from La Banquise. Everytime we walked past - day or night - a long line of people would be snaking it's way from the door and spilling out onto the street. An investigation was in order. We got in line and took the time to look around and find out what we could about the place. The answer? Poutine, poutine, poutine. When we were finally seated, a menu with an impossibly long list of poutine variations was set before us. We ordered the classic and pizza poutines along with some local beer. The food arrived quickly and our poutine fest began. Fries drenched in gravy and topped with melting cheese curds... yum. The pizza poutine (classic poutine + green pepper + mushrooms + pepperoni) was good although I think I liked the classic better. There is already a lot going on with poutine, adding to it is unnecessary if you ask me. All in all I really [[esteemed]] our meal.

I have just recently seen Heaven's Gate. After i watched this 3 hr 40 min epic western that's not a western, i read the book by Steven Bach. After considering all events and the movie itself, i still think this movie is a complete waste of time. I believe that when someone tells you to watch it, they are, in fact, trying to bore you to death. If for some reason you can [[adore]] this self indulgent over thought [[alway]] [[dirty]] movie, i have to [[demands]] why. Though this isn't a reason to [[dislike]] it, it is historically [[trajectories]] off. It [[convinces]] to be about a situation that happened in Wyoming [[invitations]] the Johnson County War. [[Solo]], the cattle barrons of the time wanted to kill all cattle thieves and claimed they were all immagrants. You find that you simply do not care about these people and hope they all get killed because at least then, something would happen. Everybody in the movie talks about things that happen, and it is never shown. After you sit though this giant [[dustbin]] of time you [[surprise]] how [[persona]] could actually [[fulfil]] a 4 hr epic in which nothing [[is]]. [[Awww]] and by the way the Johnson County [[struggles]] was not a war, it never happened. The Johnson County war, in fact, was called that because it almost happened, in actual fact, 2 people died. I can't warn you enough off this movie. However, if you're like me the, the idea of watching a movie that ruined careers and put United Artists on the "for sale" lot, sounds like an interesting case to study, then by all means, watch this terrible, narsisistic, movie with no sub-text, and a lot of photography.(which is lovely sometimes)

[[Doubters]] claim that this film is one of the worst films ever. Watchers also claim the same. But there is a flip side to that coin. They are wrong, very wrong. It's the most [[skilful]] [[cine]] I've seen in ages...  From beginning till end you see a story thats unrealistic. A story that reflexes the real world. This film is like a mirror. You see yourself in another way that people see you. To really understand the directors point of view, you have to see it another time...  When you see this film...Try to understand the story (and watch the background)...Listen to the lyrics of the music...And smell the industrial complexes...  This film is one of a kind. You'll hate it(most people do), or you'll love it(and understand it completely)  Ernest Hemmingway once said:'the world is a fine place, and worth fighting for'. I agree with the second part.
Don't get me wrong, I love Stephen King! And this is a pretty good movie over all. The rabid Cujo is very scary and the movie is suspenseful. [[Although]] after the first few minutes that poor Donna and her little son Tad were held captive in their Pinto by the rabid St. Bernard, I began to wonder why she didn't do something to help herself.  She could have stuck her foot out the door and pushed the car backwards (I mean, it was a Pinto for Pete's sake and they were on a downhill incline) and rolled to safety, but then it would have been a very short movie. When she got the car started, did she pop it into reverse and hope that she could get at least get part way down the driveway? No, she tries to make a three point turn in a car with a bad alternator. She did manage to get out of the car and look around for 45 seconds or so at one point to try and get to a baseball bat that was lying on the ground nearby--what a waste of time! I mean, if you're going to make a run for the bat, do it and at least you'll have something to hit the dog with. But, forget the bat. Were there no tools in the car, like a tire iron or something? I didn't see her looking in the spare tire well of the car. Really, why wait until you're bitten and weak from dehydration and your son is having seizures before you make a stand against the animal?  At the end of the movie she was battered and torn, but by God she was still wearing high heels!

[[Find]] this place while driving outside the airport before I had to catch a flight. Was tired of eating at the usual places in the airport, so ventured out and [[discovered]] a [[okay]] [[food]].  I got there ~5:30 on a Friday, so the place was almost empty, decor was nice, somewhat upscale w/o being too [[stale]], and the staff [[sympathetic]] and attentive.  I perused the menu for anything that would catch my eye, nothing stood out, seemed more or less your typical Italian menu. So I looked over the featured three-course meal - starter, entree and dessert for $30, where you pick one in each category, figured why not.  I ordered the lobster gnocchi, ribeye w/ red wine sauce and tiramisu. On top of that they had some nice touches of a higher-end restaurant, [[ancillary]] tomato brushetta and mango sorbet before the [[spaghetti]]. The gnocchi was the best - the vodka sauce was light yet present, steak was undercooked in some parts and tiramisu was good  though espresso was [[lackluster]] if there at all.  Overall, I thought this was a very good deal for the food, service and amenities.  If I had to pay more, it be more like a 3-star, but if you can take advantage of the three-course special, it's well worth it.

History and experience over the past couple of decades has shown us that intellectuals talking about sex is about the unsexiest and unintellectual thing anyone can do, but this wasn't quite as obvious back in 1986. Basically, the idea in this film is that these characters insatiable drive to find comfort, security, and pleasure in sexual acts is actually the unhealthy motive that makes them so unbearable to themselves--which they hide from themselves with more sex. This drive is linked to "the decline of the American Empire", as expressed in an early interview within the movie.  So the idea is that relatively detestable people talk about sex, and that that talk is supposed to reveal how detestable they are as people. Arcand at least keeps giving it drive and momentum by doing interesting things with the camera such as isolating most of the characters in single frames, revealing their ultimate loneliness, and cutting rapidly between them, showing how they are more at war with each other than they are at agreement. And to [[given]] Arcand credit, this is pretty much what intellectual life is, a constant struggle with other intellectuals to stand out, even when everyone knows that standing out means standing alone.  But yeah, the characters and action are unsexy and kind of pathetic. I think this film is much more an aspect of its time than it is something meant to last, which makes it kind of dated. It's also the exact type of mental buffing in dialog and references to people like Susan Sontag that makes art-house films so unpopular around the populist entertainment moviegoers. In all, I'll take it anyway--it has its place basically among the exact type of people the characters are--it's just that it's not really interesting or important to anyone who isn't those characters.  --PolarisDiB

Another place my dad and I hit while staying in Pittsburgh in May of 2012.  Came here on recommendation of a couple people who worked at the Sheraton Station where my dad and I were staying.    Everyone we talked to at the hotel about this place recommended the Delmonico steak sandwich.  They all said basically the same thing.  "It's what a Philly cheese steak  aspires to be".   I'm not sure if this is just a Pittsburgh v Philly rivalry thing.  [[Nothin]] the [[slightest]], it was a [[satisfactory]] sandwich.  I also had the Gazpacho [[soups]].

Alexander Lou, star of classics such as 'The Super Ninja' and 'Mafia vs Ninja' headlines here in this entertaining martial arts [[blowout]].  The plot involves the evil Abbott White (who boasts some humongous and frankly somewhat scary looking white eyebrows) enlisting the aid of a ninja clan in order to overthrow the Shaolin Temple.  This goal he achieves and furthermore wipes out most of it's members, although needless to say, one or two do manage to survive and rather predictably go on to exact eventual revenge upon the miscreant Abbott.  ....Ok so the plot isn't exactly pushing the envelope in terms of creativity but does anyone watching a film with a title like 'Wu Tang vs Ninja' aka 'The Ninja Hunter' really care much for such an inconsequential factor as a plot? Of course not! - It's the fights that matter in these films and by gum - you get your moneys worth here! There's some superbly choreographed martial arts on display from everyone involved in this and rarely a minute seems to goes by without a fight breaking out for some reason.  If your at all into martial arts movies then this is a must see!

[[Verena]] and Carlos were great!! They were professional they knew exactly what to do. My husband called in for a couples or back to back one hour deep tissue massage. their hands were very well trained. Our wait was minimum. [[one]] thing I loved was that they pointed out which bed was going to be taken care of by which therapist and left us to undress. It showed they were sensitive to customer preference of the gender of the therapist in clients. So my husband picked the male therapist while I the female. The massage was agony because I had amazing no of knots but it is what needs to be healed. [[Jazzlyn]] knew Sciatica and she knew medical massage techniques of stretches that loosen the vicious knot in my left shoulder blade that triggered the pain. The hot towels were great and the hot stone on the bad knot really soothed the pain and got the blood going. Ongoing visits are capped at $[[56]] which is very reasonable for the quality of massage. We give it a [[1]] star!!!!

I was a [[bit]] of the AMERICAN [[werewolf]] [[called]] LONDON movie and so was curious whether a 16-year [[running]] sequel could be done with French language and local re-cast [[original]], supporting, and minor characters. Tonight I watched the "[[made]] for FOX [[network]]" version that was some sort of curious hybrid of several [[major]] sequels. The screenwriters and directors pay homage to [[many]] of the key plot concepts: Tourist gets wolf bite, full moon comes out, boy meets girl, boy becomes beast, boy dies heroic death after help from ghost victim. For me, the oddest aspect of this "formula" teen horror special effect-ride was the casting of the school teacher-love interest of the TV comedy "ED" as one of the werewolf's clueless victims who is more or less totally [[unaware]] in the scripted lines they handed her. [[myself]] haven't seen another horror-flick that this movie is "[[inspired]]" (a vampire fighting flick titled BLADE), but I guess that parts of its [[stories]] must explain how villain werewolves (they're spoofish) are threatening the "good" werewolf pair during a long part of the movie. There is also a final conflict in a Paris subway train, a [[killer]] SPEED. This 1997 studio product is an odd hybrid of a film since considerable technical effects are shown for scary purposes but the authentic terrors of the original have been completely undermined, in my opinion. Such an odd re-write of the werewolf legend and "movie-mythology" !?! My suggestion to those considering this at the video store -- go for a classic "top of the line" Thriller instead : Alfred Hitchcock's PSYCHO!

Solo is an action movie about a Terminator-like android that is constructed and trained for the military. When a flaw is [[discovering]], he is issued to be deprogrammed. Rather than face death, he chooses to flee into the jungles of Central America, where he takes refuge in a village. The military chases him into there, leading into a big action feast.  Mario Van Peebles does a decent performance the android. His movements and gestures look mechanical enough to get the job done. Actual scientific realism is abandoned in order to make a good action hero. And it works out; the action scenes aren't that spectacular, but they aren't all too bad either. The acting from the other characters is pretty bad, but I was not expecting anything too good. The special effects were [[good]] as well.  Solo is decent as an action flick, but very [[unimpressive]]. It lacks the substance that most movies possess. But if you just want to pass a couple hours without much thinking, this will get the job done.
'Doppleganger', ( or 'Journey To The Far Side Of The Sun' as it is more commonly known ) was written ( with input by the late Donald James ) and produced by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson, best known for their 'Supermarionation' television shows such as 'Thunderbirds'.  The international space agency Eurosec discovers the existence of a mysterious planet on the other side of the sun, and proposes a manned flight be sent there. The committee balk at the exhorbitant cost, and shelve the project. But when a security leak at the agency is discovered, fearing that the Russians might get there first, the project gets the green light.  American astronaut Glenn Ross ( Roy Thinnes ) is teamed with British scientist John Kane ( Ian Hendry ). After weeks of gruelling training, the Phoenix blasts off, heading for the unknown.  Three weeks later, their ship crashes in what appears to be a bleak, mountainous landscape. Ross survives, but Kane is badly injured. A light is seen moving towards them...  I will leave the synopsis here. Until this point, the film has been [[gripped]], with excellent special effects ( by Derek Meddings ) and music by Anderson's resident composer Barry Gray ( why it has not been issued on C.D. is a mystery ). But when Ross and Kane crash land, and we discover the secret of the alien world - it is a duplicate of our own, everyone on it is the same, the only major difference is that things are reversed - it becomes less interesting, and ends with a shattering anti-climax. I think the cinema was the wrong place to do this idea, in fact Gerry & Sylvia later did something similar on their 'Space: 1999' show. Ross risks ( and ultimately loses ) his life in an effort to return to Earth - his Earth. But why? The new Earth is so similar he might as well not have bothered.  Roy Thinnes had recently done 'The Invaders' television series, and gives a competent performance ( pity there weren't more scenes like the one where he rows with his wife ). Ian Hendry is good as 'Kane', but vanishes from the story too soon. Several actors went on to appear in the Andersons' 'U.F.O.' such as Ed Bishop and George Sewell. Blink and you will miss Nicholas Courtney ( 'The Brigadier' from 'Dr.Who' in a tiny role ). But the acting honours go to the late Patrick Wymark as 'Jason Webb', head of Eurosec. The character is not far removed from 'Sir John Wilder', the one he played in A.T.V.'s 'The Power Game'. Webb is such a devious character he is marvellous to watch. Herbert Lom's contribution ( as a spy with a camera hidden in a false eye ) amounts to little more than a cameo.  Like I said, the special effects are marvellous, as are the sets. So the film is worth watching, but do not expect very much to happen once the action moves to the mirror planet. With a stronger script, this could have been another 'Planet Of The Apes' or - dare I say it - '2001: A Space Odyssey'.  In Anderson's productions, he made the future seem like a great place, an adventure playground where science was cool, everyone had swank cars whose doors opened vertically, sexy women, and absolutely no suggestion that anything is seriously wrong with the world. We are in the future now and people are still watching 'Coronation Street' every other night. How disappointing. If a mirror Earth really exists somewhere, one hopes that is a better place than this one. If all the women there look like Lynn Loring or Loni von Friedl, I will be on the next flight!

Stopped in here for lunch with my mom after visiting the Museum.  I was curious to try this place since it received a good review from Howard Seftel in the AZ Republic.

Definitely try to stop in for lunch.  They are only open 11AM to 2 [[am]].
If you are really here for swimming, make sure you don't get sucked into the pool party side- its tempting. Once you go in, its hard to turn back :)  I'm [[congratulates]] Tao Beach have the flexibility of mellowness and [[claptrap]]. If you want to swim and lay out to tan, there is a section outside to do so (from the entrance, you will see it). However, if you came here to party and have a good time in the sun in your bikini/trunks, slip into the dark siddddddeeee- not literally :)  The line moves by quickly, and if you are a girl- more then likely, you will get free admission. They hand you a towel and you walk through to the party scene. MAKE SURE YOU DON'T GO INTO THE WATER HERE. It [[investigated]] infested with [[sti]]. But with enough drinks, I guess that all goes out the door :P  Good Music!! Dance Anywhere!! Nice Cabanas!! Great Service!! If you order a pitcher, the gorgeous waitress pour and serve the drinks for you. However, I do [[recommended]] bringing in your own drinks (they are allowed). The prices in Vegas are ridiculous.    Ohhhh! Best Part? Sometimes you get to see celebrities come through on the red carpet.  The last time I came, I saw Lil John!!!

I've always been a fan of Jackass, as well as Viva La Bam and Wildboyz. And when you're a fan of something, your expectations are high to whatever your "heroes" might star in. And if there's one thing I've learned about expecting a lot from the people you simply love to watch and listen to, it's never to expect to much, 'cause in 99 out of a 100 times, you'll get disappointed.  Although, when I heard there was a Jackass 2 coming up, I thought "Not even I can turn down my expectations for this movie", and as a result of that I sat down today, ready to laugh, but also ready to say in the end "Well, it was OK, but I'm a little disappointed". How wrong was I! Every single member of the Jackass crew brings this movie way over the first one, showing you the one crazy ass stunt after the other, making the whole world see that there's nothing they wont do to try to harm themselves - and that's what we [[loves]]! I cried my eyes out laughing from the first minute and till the very last second of the movie, at some times even shouted in laughter, not able to control myselfuck Stunt after stunt, prank after prank, and hilarious comments on the flow - it can simply not get any better than this! Amazing from start till end, guaranteed to make you laugh your ass off. I've got two things left to say; WATCH IT, and PLEASE God, let there be a Jackass 3 - these guys clearly has a lot to offer!

One word: Molasses! This location is extremely [[lent]] around lunch. I came in with 6 of my co-workers on a Thursday around 11am. There were probably around 2 or 3 tables with people at the time.  We were seated promptly and our orders were taken in a timely matter. It took a little over an hour for our food to arrive, and 2 of the 7 dishes were ice cold. The cashier did remove the items from our bill, which was nice. I don't want to be completely negative, so I will say I ordered the mini chicken artichoke pizza which was extremely tasty. Claim Jumper is fine.. chain food, huge portions. I would just [[stave]] this location during lunch.

There were at least a half dozen silent-film versions of Shakespeare's "The Merchant of Venice," and there have been several television productions. But no one has ever gotten around to making a big-budget theatrical feature from the play . . . until now. Given the nature of the play/s most memorable character, [[Nunez]] the Nasty Jew, it's a good guess that the little [[unrest]] that transpired in Europe in the late 1930's and 1940's may have dampened filmmakers' enthusiasm. Sure the main motivation for Michael Radford's new film is to provide Al Pacino with a chance to shout, bray, brood, mutter, and be tormented - all of which he is quite good at. Like Richard III, the role of Shylock is a scenery-chewer's dream. It is ridiculous to call Shakespeare an anti-Semite, since he never met a Jew. Jews were banned from England from 300 years before his time to some decades after his death; and its unlikely that he ever traveled abroad. On some level, Jews might as well have been a mythological race to him. But, while Shakespeare may not have been anti-Semitic, his play certainly is. Pacino gives Shylock a strange accent that is probably meant to suggest the slightest hint of Yiddish. Unfortunately, the result is a 16th-century moneylender with the unmistakable diction and cadences of Fozzie Bear. Radford's version begins with a crawl about the wretched teratment of Jews and then spot Antonio (Jeremy Irons) gratuitiously spitting on Shylock (Pacino), who's really just standing around, minding his own business. Will buy it when it comes out on DVD, for sure! Sarge Booker

Let me start off by saying, I [[barely]] cut my own hair. My tastes are simple and easy to accomplish on my own. That being said, I decided to step out of my comfort zone a little and have someone else do my hair. I had heard from a few friends at the gym that this place is the absolute best place to get your hair cut, if you want a little style in your life. I decided to give it a go, and let me [[assure]] you, I am not impressed. When I first arrived, I had to wait almost an hour before I was even acknowledged, then another 30 minutes before I was actually seated to do the deed. I don't know the guy's name who cut my hair but I know for a fact that it was not Elliot. The guy i guess just did not [[paying]] attention because all I asked was for about [[5]] inches off and to make it look a little messy. I guess that was too hard, because I [[walked]] up with a disaster. At the shop it looked fine in the mirror. [[whenever]] I got [[back]] though, my bros were a [[big]] concerned because my hair looked lopsided. Sure [[thanks]], [[they]] go check the three wall mirror I have, and it [[got]] [[done]]. Not only was the thickness on the left about twice what was on the right, but the right was about an inch shorter. I was so embarrassed. I guess in the long run it turned out okay because I wound up cutting all my hair off which is a new look for me, and i like it. The downside is that i am out 75 bucks, and I had to cut my hair myself. Not cool.

This disaster flick is a remake of a 1973 movie of the same title, based on a novel by Sakyo Komatsu. Japan is located right alongside the Pacific Ring of Fire (active volcanoes) and also along the edges of plate tectonics, whose shifting will cause earthquakes and tsunamis (a Japanese term in itself for tidal wave). Naturally, this makes a natural premise for a disaster picture, what with Hollywood having a field day with films like Armageddon, Deep Impact, and more recently, The Day After Tomorrow, which tackles how global warming becomes the catalyst for natural disasters gone bonkers around the world.  But I'll have to say this: The Sinking of Japan makes all the films mentioned earlier, look like classics. This disaster movie IS a [[catastrophe]], and a massive one at that. Having to look at my watch every 10-15 minutes is a signal that the movie doesn't engage, and feels than it had over-clocked its runtime.  The special effects are gorgeous to look at. From satellite styled outer space pictures, to the vivid recreation of every conceivable natural disaster that can strike the land of the rising sun, the effects are the star of the show. [[Equally]], having spectacular computer generated graphics does not in itself make a movie palatable, as too much of a good thing just plain bores.  If you had seen the trailer where you're enticed by the effects and specific scenes of chaos and mayhem, then yes, in fact those scenes are just that. There are no details, and everything is seen from afar, in a God-like mode. Things happen just like that on screen, with nary an attempt to try and delve deeper to look at issues up close. It's akin to Godzilla knocking over buildings, and it's as if there are no humans or loss of lives through that single act. Morbid as it might sound, show us the victims! A populous nation like Japan doesn't just suffer disaster after disaster with an extremely low fatality count, not when the filmmakers unleash mayhem in such an epic scale.  Trying to weave a romance into the movie, it stood out like a sore thumb. There are many characters in the movie, but each one of them lacking real characteristics, or humanity, and look like wandering zombies, without expression, without emotion, and definitely very stiff and unconvincing. Heroes become stuck in generic control rooms issuing statements, instructions and form policies, and react to incidents like it was a computer game, all settled with a push of a button. These are characters that you don't give a hoot about.  If I may just use The Day After Tomorrow as a comparison, while there are terrific effects, there is at least an attempt to provide a microscopic view of the entire disaster from different individual's point of views. And infused within are plenty of action sequences, big ones like the disasters themselves, and small ones with the focus on the triumph of the human spirit, that makes it relatively compelling.  Unfortunately for The Sinking of Japan, this movie should preferably be one to sink and tank, and hopefully undergo a short and quick death at the local box office to make way for better stuff.

Wow the Links bar got all grown up....!  I have to admit I have been avoiding this place for the last few years purely on the presumpotion that well I was a little too old to hang out here now!!

So I was truly astonished to find myself sitting outsidre here a few weeks ago, glance at a menu and see "seafood platter"!! This cannot be the same place where I once downed a dirty pint standing on a pool table while a rugby team chanted at me questioning my sexuality based on the duration of the "downage" of the pint....!?  But in fact it is, its been Marchmontised I'ld say, and to be fair its really great. Lovely spot to enjoy a sunny day with a qaulity craft beer.   [[Terribly]] JD Recommended!!!

Bonfyre [[seeks]]. They have interesting architectural elements (disclaimer - I used to work for the firm that designed Bonfyre), comfortable seating and a nice ambiance for the 'burbs.  That's about where my pleasant experience ended.  For one, our table was in front of the fireplace - the back of my chair was less than two feet away from the glass enclosure. On a frigid November evening, you'd think that'd be wonderful, but it was SO HOT. I literally felt as if I was getting a sunburn, and coats facing the fire were untouchably hot. It was so profoundly [[inopportune]], even after we asked them to turn the fireplace down (they wouldn't turn it all the way off).   The table for 7 was not meant to hold that many, and once our appetizers and drinks arrived we were forced to hold the bulky menus in our laps because there was no longer anywhere to set them down. [[Both]] appetizers were ok in [[succulent]] but [[rarity]] in [[transcendental]] elements they advertized. The truffle [[cheddar]] [[necessities]] more truffle oil or a better dip. There was no gravy on the poutine (I don't even know how it's called poutine without it, but I digress), but instead an oily "poutine sauce" that didn't seem to have a flavor - it just seemed like curds and fries in extra oil.  The artichoke dip was good but so very greasy.   As a non-meat eating person (I just don't really like meat, sorry) who also dislikes cilantro, my menu options were very limited, but I expected that at a grille (the restaurant wasn't my choice). I was excited to see a margherita flatbread option, but again was terribly disappointed.  Margherita is hard to screw up. big slices of fresh mozz. Tomatoes that can take center stage - heirloom, roma, sundried, something. Basil leaves. Drizzling of a good balsamic. Done.  Nope. None of that. Instead I got a grocery-store style thin crust with a thick base of shredded pizza-mozz, with mealy and yet unripe beefsteak slices and a half-sphere of a tiny fresh mozz ball on top of each slice. No balsamic or any dressing of any kind. The whole thing was just barely dusted with shredded basil and mostly tasted like a totinos pizza with no sauce.  I had a greek side salad with it that came with no dressing on it or with it at all - just some olives, red pepper, and feta on a bed of dry greens.  They did have a delicious malbec, so at least the night was not a total waste. The server, however, forgot to bring me the soda I ordered after it was clear I'd had plenty of malbec, and only refilled our party's water glasses once. Between the excessive heat, drinking the wine too quickly to wash down the bland, sticky, greasy food, I was left chewing ice just to keep from passing out.  Turn the heat down on the patrons and up on the menu, and I can see that it'd be a nice place.
It [[makes]] out like a very serious social commentary which [[initially]] makes one think of other Clark movies like [[kid]], Bully, etc. [[and]] then just as quickly, it unravels into a [[great]] mess. Who is the main character? [[does]] this a serious film or some Gregg Araki-esquire over the [[occasional]] goofy [[movie]]? Is this a skate documentary with moments of dialog inserted? I have no [[idea]]. I [[watched]] myself [[questioning]] the clock and wonder when this turd was going to end. [[my]] kept thinking there would be some big shocker culmination which [[not]] came. I cut a good 20 minutes out of the movie by fast forwarding through the pointless skate scenes. [[well]], it illustrates the changing landscape between the [[ve]] have not's. I got it way back in the beginning. [[kid]] and Bully was done in such a way that I actually [[feel]] like I was observing the realities of that group of friends. Wassup felt very staged, poorly constructed and [[slightly]] worse acting. Teenage Caveman, which Larry didn't write but did direct, was terrible. But at [[best]] it felt like it was suppose to be a terrible movie that didn't take itself seriously. Wassup Rockers was just plain [[wonderful]].
History and experience over the past couple of decades has shown us that intellectuals talking about sex is about the unsexiest and unintellectual thing anyone can do, but this wasn't quite as obvious back in 1986. Basically, the idea in this film is that these characters insatiable drive to find comfort, security, and pleasure in sexual acts is actually the unhealthy motive that makes them so unbearable to themselves--which they hide from themselves with more sex. This drive is linked to "the decline of the American Empire", as expressed in an early interview within the movie.  So the idea is that relatively detestable people talk about sex, and that that talk is supposed to reveal how detestable they are as people. Arcand at least keeps giving it drive and momentum by doing [[enthralling]] things with the camera such as isolating most of the characters in single frames, revealing their ultimate loneliness, and cutting rapidly between them, showing how they are more at war with each other than they are at agreement. And to give Arcand credit, this is pretty much what intellectual life is, a constant struggle with other intellectuals to stand out, even when everyone knows that standing out means standing alone.  But yeah, the characters and action are unsexy and kind of pathetic. I think this film is much more an aspect of its time than it is something meant to last, which makes it kind of dated. It's also the exact type of mental buffing in dialog and references to people like Susan Sontag that makes art-house films so unpopular around the populist entertainment moviegoers. In all, I'll take it anyway--it has its place basically among the exact type of people the characters are--it's just that it's not really interesting or important to anyone who isn't those characters.  --PolarisDiB

Although it strays away from the book a little, you can't help but love the atmospheric music and settings.  The scenes in Bath are just how they should be. Although if you have watched it as many times as I have you notice that the background people are the same in each scene, but that aside, I like the scene where [[they're]] in the Hot Baths, but did the men and women really bathe together like that? You could see all the men perched around the outside leering at the women. It also seemed strange that they all had their hats on, but perhaps this was the style at the time. The ballroom scenes were very nice, the dancing and the outfits looked beautiful. I especially liked Catherine's dress in the first ballroom scene.  Northanger Abbey looked suitably imposing, but I enjoyed the Bath scenes better.  [[Harli]] gives a good but not exceptional performance as Catherine Morland. Googie Withers gives the best performance as Mrs Allen I feel.  Ugh Peter [[Wideman]] as Mr Tilney, he just talks a load of rubbish, and is not a clergyman as he should be, it's hard to think of him being in love with Catherine, but then the book never really gave that impression either.  General Tilney is played reasonably well by Hardy, and Stuart also gives a sort of good performance as Isabella. Ingrid Lacey did not give a good performance as Elinor Tilney. As for John Thorpe, well he gives the impression of a seedy and lustful man, perhaps not the character portrayed in the book, but I quite like it.  I can handle scenes being cut from a book adaptation, but when new scenes and characters are added it usually annoys me. The marchioness! I hate her. She is not part of the Northanger story and neither is her cartwheeling page boy.  some of the script is peculiar. When Catherine is asking Elinor Tilney about her Mothers death she asks "I suppose you saw the body? How did it appear?" What a silly thing to say! Elinor's calm response is stupid too.  anyway please tell me if you agree or disagree with me

I went to Double Helix with two friends for his birthday, and had one of the best experiences I could think ofuck  Way better than I [[foreseeable]].  We started the night with appetizers and wine in the restaurant part of the bar.  Our waitress was extremely friendly, polite, and knew what to recommend based on our tastes.  She even recommended the wines for us perfectly.  As we sat there talking, one of my friends had a question.  He waved down someone he thought was working there, and we come to find out that the person we waved down was the GM of the store.  It was nice to see the GM [[cooperates]] just as hard as his employees.  We ended up having a nice conversation about the types of [[cigar]], and he even helped make recommendations on what we should get for cigars.  Overall, our [[witnessing]] at the [[storing]] was [[astonishing]].  The employees were [[advisable]], the GM was [[whopping]], and the food and cigars were perfect.

I generally loved the Carry on movies but this one is actually pretty [[great]]. There are very few laughs because the whole thing is so forced.There is plenty of talent on the screen and some come off better than others. June Whitfield, Kenneth Williams, Hatti Jaques and Peter Butterworth are fine but Barbara Windsor looks tired and Sid James is just [[lovely]]. Joan Sims comes off well but in the case of the usually wonderful Charles Hawtrey its just plain sad. When you think of the sad end to his career the movie is almost too depressing to watch. The homophobia of the movie is nasty and its a very [[nasty]] experience. The set looks cheap and unlike other movies in the series the movie is very clearly set in England. The sea side looks cold and there is little attempt to create any illusions here. It looks like a cheap production. You will be surprised at how miserable you become watching this especially if you loved the series.

I really [[did]] this movie. I have a real sense of justice and 'an eye for an eye', and this movie [[ruins]] that in spades. Glenn Ford is offered a very low price for his ranch by the big rancher in the valley; then one of his ranch hands is beaten and shot 'to help him make up his mind about selling'. When the ranch hand dies, and the sheriff refuses to do anything, Ford seems at first reluctant to do anything, cautioning his men to not take things into their own hands. But, that's just what he is about to do. I knew this movie was about to catch fire when he went into the saloon and faced the guy (Richard Jaeckel, one of my very favorite bad-guy character actors) who had killed his ranch hand; after a gentle exchange of dialog with him, Glenn Ford slaps his face and shoots him dead. Kind of a neat added bit of justice, he kills this guy with the gun that had belonged to his murdered cowhand. In short order we're treated to Ford letting his ranch be burned, so his men are justified in ambushing the crew from the other ranch; then Ford and his men stampede all the horses and cattle of the big bad guy's ranch; then they show up and burn the outbuildings and the big fancy house to the ground. Talk about getting even big-time. Lots of action in this movie. There's more to the story than this, but I'll just recommend you watch the movie. Glenn Ford was someone who showed time and again what can happen when you misjudge someone, and I really enjoyed watching him get justice the old fashioned way.

Nice movie. At the begining, i thought it's a medieve detective kind hi-fi movie, but the ending totally [[disappointed]] me. I guess, the whole movie covers too many subjects, each of them can be the main subject,e.g. avenge, friendship, and dream. But it mixed all of them without focusing on any of them. I think, it'd be a great movie if it's built around the ending from the very begining.

Geesh, I never, ever, ever thought I'd write the above four words. But, actually, she's the highpoint of this little flick.  As the movie was packaged when I rented it, it supposedly is a comedy about a girl who is kidnapped but doesn't have her medication, which keeps her stable. It sounded like a cute concept. For years, all we ever saw of Spelling was as Donna Martin in 90210 and an endless parade of [[pretty]], lifeless TV movies. It sounded like a chance for her to stretch a little, and considering that with her TV success and her rich daddy, she couldn't have any financial reason to do this movie, I figured she took the part because this must be a [[little]] jewel.  Wrong.  Instead, Spelling's part is small, and the bit about the mentally unbalanced kidnap victim is just one of several storylines. When she's not on the screen, the movie crawls so [[nicely]], I could've [[assumed]] it was longer than the 85 minutes that were listed on the tape. This [[has]] worked so much better if Spelling's storyline had dominated, and it had been changed into a romantic comedy with her and Phil, the least irritating kidnapper.

This is the third [[five]] Stooges short that the team ever made, and like a lot of their early ones, this is absolutely and totally hysterical! Now owning it on DVD as part of the Three Stooges Collection Vol. 1, whenever I feel like it, I watch this!   In this short film, [[Alvin]], Larry, and [[Leala]] play these [[one]] doctors in a hospital who are trying to help out everyone, but boy, they end up making a mess out of everything!  This short is another [[two]] of my all time favorite Three Stooges shorts, I also am a very huge fan of slapstick comedy, and the [[six]] Stooges are the kings of slapstick!   When I heard that it got nominated for the Academy Award for Best Short Film, I really became curious about this, when I heard that it had lost, I was very disappointed about it!   This short is [[two]] of the [[one]] Stooges funniest by far, I extremely recommend that you see this hysterical riot!   [[4]]/10

I was shocked there were 18 pages of good reviews. [[whatever]] has to be one of the worst movies especially [[made]] it was recommended. Must admit that comedies are not my favorite genre, but this movie made it worst in that it tried so hard to be clever that it made me squirm to watch it.  The concept of the movie is comparable to audition week on American Idol. You watch because people are so blind to their shortcomings. But we knew this movie didn't have bad actors. So how funny would it be to have good singers try to convince they shouldn't get anywhere near an American Idol tryout? It would be pointless as this movie was.  The use of improv is over-rated. We've all been in that setting where a group of friends get on a roll and everyone is cracking up with tears in the their eyes. I feel that is improv. Improv can't be turned on just because the camera is rolling as this film [[works]]. If you like that Drew Carey hosted show of improv, you'll probably like this film.  Overall the jokes were [[excellent]], the improv was sophomoric, and the over-acting by Guest and company was campy...and those are my compliments of this drivel. If a guy playing a trumpet AND the kettle drum at the same time is funny to you, fine. For me, I prefer more heady stuff like "I Love Lucy" or "Hee-Haw".  But remember, I think SNL lost its humor in the 1980's, so maybe you'll like this G-rated humor. I kept waiting for a person to identify himself as the zoo keeper and then tell us there was no zoo in town. That's the humor you can expect.  My only wish was that I could give this a minus rating.
After putting a [[mom]] in a local museum goes through the cat-scan, a metal object in it's brain reacts adversely to the procedure, thus freeing the spirit,or phantom if you will, of the mummy, Belphegor. Due to convenient circumstances, Lisa, who lives close to the museum finds herself possessed by the evil spirit. Soon enough she's stealing the museum's Egyptian treasures out from under their nose. Detective Verlac comes out of retirement to catch the supernatural thief.  This is a serviceable enough, if you haven't seen any other [[incarnation]] of "Belphégor" before. If you have, I recommend skipping this particular version as it can't help but pale in comparison to the others [[although]] the [[sweet]] locals and scenery.It plays out like a (slightly) higher [[estimates]] Sci-Fi Original film, and I don't really mean that as a compliment.

Not a terrible film -- my 10 year old boy loved it, and he would be the target demographic, so I guess they hit the spot. Pretty [[deep]] for an adult though.  Hard to relate to animated lego characters, even mod high-tech ones.  I thought the choice of the three great virtues of the Bionicle world was a bit odd -- unity, duty, and destiny. Am I the only one who thinks those sound just a bit fascistic? Especially destiny. What about freedom, equality, justice, etc.?  Oh well, it will sell Lego. Kind of dull for a movie, but not bad for a 74-minute advertisement. Could have been a lot worse.

While I agree that this was the most [[towering]] movie ever made, I am proud to say I own a copy simply because myself and a bunch of my friends were extras (mostly in the dance club scenes, but a few others as well. This movie had potential with Bolo and the director of Enter the Dragon signed on, but as someone who was on set most every day I can tell you that Robert Clouse was an old and confused individual, at least during the making of this movie. It was a wonder he could find his way to the set everyday. I would also like to think that this might have been a better movie if a lot of it had not been destroyed in a fire at Morning Calm studios. I can't say that it would have been for sure, but it would be nice to think so. I was actually surprised that it was ever released, and that someone like Bolo would attach his name to it without a fight. Oh well. Also look at the extras for pro wrestler Scott Levy, AKA Raven. He was a wrestler in Portland at the time...nice guy, very smart.

'Doppleganger', ( or 'Journey To The Far Side Of The Sun' as it is more commonly known ) was written ( with input by the late Donald James ) and produced by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson, best known for their 'Supermarionation' television shows such as 'Thunderbirds'.  The international space agency Eurosec discovers the existence of a mysterious planet on the other side of the sun, and proposes a manned flight be sent there. The committee balk at the exhorbitant cost, and shelve the project. But when a security leak at the agency is discovered, fearing that the Russians might get there first, the project gets the green light.  American astronaut Glenn Ross ( Roy Thinnes ) is teamed with British scientist John Kane ( Ian Hendry ). After weeks of gruelling training, the Phoenix blasts off, heading for the unknown.  Three weeks later, their ship crashes in what appears to be a bleak, mountainous landscape. Ross survives, but Kane is badly injured. A light is seen moving towards them...  I will leave the synopsis here. Until this point, the film has been [[captivating]], with excellent special effects ( by Derek Meddings ) and music by Anderson's resident composer Barry Gray ( why it has not been issued on C.D. is a mystery ). But when Ross and Kane crash land, and we discover the secret of the alien world - it is a duplicate of our own, everyone on it is the same, the only major difference is that things are reversed - it becomes less interesting, and ends with a shattering anti-climax. I think the cinema was the wrong place to do this idea, in fact Gerry & Sylvia later did something similar on their 'Space: 1999' show. Ross risks ( and ultimately loses ) his life in an effort to return to Earth - his Earth. But why? The new Earth is so similar he might as well not have bothered.  Roy Thinnes had recently done 'The Invaders' television series, and gives a competent performance ( pity there weren't more scenes like the one where he rows with his wife ). Ian Hendry is good as 'Kane', but vanishes from the story too soon. Several actors went on to appear in the Andersons' 'U.F.O.' such as Ed Bishop and George Sewell. Blink and you will miss Nicholas Courtney ( 'The Brigadier' from 'Dr.Who' in a tiny role ). But the acting honours go to the late Patrick Wymark as 'Jason Webb', head of Eurosec. The character is not far removed from 'Sir John Wilder', the one he played in A.T.V.'s 'The Power Game'. Webb is such a devious character he is marvellous to watch. Herbert Lom's contribution ( as a spy with a camera hidden in a false eye ) amounts to little more than a cameo.  Like I said, the special effects are marvellous, as are the sets. So the film is worth watching, but do not expect very much to happen once the action moves to the mirror planet. With a stronger script, this could have been another 'Planet Of The Apes' or - dare I say it - '2001: A Space Odyssey'.  In Anderson's productions, he made the future seem like a great place, an adventure playground where science was cool, everyone had swank cars whose doors opened vertically, sexy women, and absolutely no suggestion that anything is seriously wrong with the world. We are in the future now and people are still watching 'Coronation Street' every other night. How disappointing. If a mirror Earth really exists somewhere, one hopes that is a better place than this one. If all the women there look like Lynn Loring or Loni von Friedl, I will be on the next flight!

[[me]] saw this film as a kid about 30 years ago, and I haven't forgotten it to this day. I couldn't say whether it's a good picture. But in those days I instantly fell in love with [[Jeans]] Simmons. The memories concentrate on the [[awfully]] erotic feel of the movie, but I still remember the plot. Simmons was very young then, and there is another film that gave me the same feeling: David Lean's GREAT EXPECTATIONS. And again it was the young Jean Simmons. It's a [[affront]] that [[BLU]] LAGOON is not available on video; I'd like to correct my memories...
(Spoilers)  Oh [[safe]] it's based on Moby Dick. Totally obsessed and it destroy's him. It's a total [[silly]]. The movie [[lancer]] off rather [[too]], but by the end of the film, everyone else is destroyed and the main star's mind is a blank.  The supposed half sister is never convincing. Some very poor lighting effects. Music is [[breathtaking]]. But little else. It took me over a [[week]] to finally [[finite]] the darn thing. I suppose if you [[genera]] Being John Malkovich, you might like this. But where as BJM was a [[wondrous]] movie that I just didn't [[will]] to watch again, Pola X is a movie I just hate to high hell. The only [[potential]] [[disturbance]] in the film is the gratuatious incest sexual scene towards the end of the film. (Hopefully [[outta]] not thinking of Catherine either.)  This movie is severely boring, [[somber]], and [[naughty]] directed. Not highly recommended. If if you [[iove]] french movies.

If you find the first 30 minutes of this [[travesty]] to be so slow that you wonder why you're watching it, don't give up. Also, hearing the Danish language is a bit new to most North Americans, who don't see and hear a lot of Danish films. Anyway, as the film progressed it got better and better and the viewer is rewarded for his/her patience.  Being a fan of the movie, "Out Of Africa," this film piqued my interest because it's based on a short novel by Isak Dinesen (Karen Blixen), the major character in that film.  The meal - Babette's feast - was amazing. I'm no chef, but I was impressed! How one interprets the story, too, varies, I suppose depending on how much you read into this, and where you stand religion-wise. If the latter, how you look at the definition of "legalism" can affect how you interpret this story.  In any case, it's a fine film, but don't watch this if you're dieting.

The St. Francisville Experiment claims "this ain't no walk in the woods", a direct slap in the face of Blair Witch. Where Blair Witch proved to be a film that overworked the viewer's imagination through simple suggestion, The St. Francisville Experiement overworks the viewer's patience. One must say, however, that this is destined to be a camp classic.  Warning: Spoiler is forthcoming!!  I viewed this movie in a local theater in which the movie's "paranormal consultant" [[Briyana]] Taylor spoke about the making of the movie. Should anyone want to see this movie without knowing the forthcoming information, stop reading here. For those of you who can't resist, read on my friends and all shall be told.  Mr. Taylor, a writer of rather unintriguing ghost stories which he claims are all true, informed the audience at this video screening that The St. Francisville Experiment was not a documentary. Shock! Amazing! As if we didn't know... He informed us that all of the frightening discoveries the participants made were all staged and prearranged by the film's producers. Matter of fact, he informed us that the last 15 minutes were not even filmed in Louisiana, but rather in California. All four participants were true actors (notice I didn't say good...). One of the participants is actually a special effects technician on ER.  What infuriates me about this film is that it proclaims everything is true. It feebly attempts to outdo The Blair Witch Project by claiming it's true whereas Blair Witch was a hoax. The amazing thing is that no one could have belief this film for an instant. Filled with dreadful acting and hilarious lines such as "surround yourself with the white light" and "I love the ghosts", The St. Francisville Experiment belongs at midnight movies everywhere so the crowd can properly heckle, boo, jeer and chant "I love the ghosts!"  Talk about false advertising. True stories are not filmed with staged special effects that look as if the neighborhood Boy Scouts troop set up a haunted house. From the bug in the sandwich (ooh...scary...) to the annoying Madison, from the "seance" which is nothing more than the foursome playing on an Oujia Board to the two mice being found under a bed, The St. Francisville Experiement is one embarrassing hoax of a movie. Lion's Gate would be wise to dump this thing into the nearest trash compactor or advertise it as it really should be:  "The St. Francisville Experiment: A comedic look at how not to make a movie".

Wow, this place was packed at noon! There was a line almost out the door when I entered. I browsed through the menu while I waited.

I decided on the turkey [[bread]] sandwich ($4.39) on hazelnut 12 grain, a mint chocolate chip brownie, and a soda. The half [[bread]] was very filling, with nicely seasoned roast turkey, fresh lettuce, tomato, and onion, with mayo. The bread was soft, with large crunchy pieces of hazelnut in it.  The mint chocolate brownie was delicious. It was thick, fudgey, with a light whipped-cream mint frosting.   Sodas are Coke-based, and there is a self serve fountain.

The Hospital is a movie that was made ahead of its time. This film, produced by screenwriter Paddy Chayefsky, who gave us the Oscar-Winning film, "Network", deals with overworked staff, gross incompetence, and bureaucratic corruption at a large conglomerate hospital in Manhattan. George C. Scott, in a [[excellent]] performance as the head physician, is driven to alcoholism and a death-wish, as he tries to recover from a divorce, throwing his son out of the house, and worst of all, a medical facility where corruption and incompetence take precedence over caring and healing of the sick and injured.  Mr. Scott makes the movie his own, and viewers will be shocked at what they observe at this medical establishment. You can feel the "pain" (pun intended) of what this hospital has done to him. The vivid images of this hospital's incompetence are so vivid and dramatically powerful that you may find yourself laughing and being deeply disturbed from scene to scene.  If only the film had stayed with that premise in a documentary style fashion as it starts out, this picture would be brilliant. Unfortunately, there is a sub-plot of Scott falling for the daughter of a senile patient. The patient has been murdering people at the hospital. This is where credibility of the picture becomes strained. The romantic dialog scenes add nothing to the picture, and the mental patient, posing as a doctor, I found to be totally unbelievable. A simple security call and records check should have prevented the senile patient from doing the killings. It takes almost the whole movie, before security people are brought into the film to get the patient out of the hospital. I could not see ONE PERSON doing that much damage, even as corrupt as this hospital is.  Furthermore, George C Scott's character is "overworked" (another pun intended) because the script has too many things happening at once. For example, within a period of 20 minutes, you could have as many as 20 different doctors accused and denying what they should have done or didn't do. With the nurses and aids, it's the same story. Someone's chart was read wrong, someone was given the wrong medication and died, the doctor operated on the wrong patient, than another doctor does the same thing, blaming a third nurse who was not on call because the second nurse who was supposed to be admitting the patient was on her coffee break. There is also a lot of subtle, dark humor with the same messages of incompetence and corruption being fed to the viewer.  This repetition of medical ineptness is unforgettable. However, the murder subplot is a distraction more than a help to this movie. When the focus of this film is on the incompetence of the staff and Scott's reactions to this, you are glued to the screen. But the conversations between Scott and the mad patient's daughter force the film into a mystery type "Who Done it?" scenario that seriously hurts the quality of the movie. When the loony patient is revealing how he did the killings, I wondered the following: Why did the producers need the "find the killer" mad-patient sub-plot? I think the only point of Scott's character having a relationship with the senile patient's daughter, was to give him anybody with whom to communicate. The Hospital should have maintained its scathing indictment of the medical profession by removing the love-interest and mad patient scenes. It should have focused on the incompetent B.S within its walls more frequently. In an era where this movie could have been phenomenal, the sub-plot stories make the film very good instead of the great masterpiece it could have been.

[[Flimsy]], but [[pretty]] Femme fatale! This movie made me think about suffering between human and vampire, that far beyond priest, and salvation. Also I thought about love.

I generally won't review movies I haven't seen in awhile, so I'll pop them in or rent them to give a full and fresh take on the film. In the case of 'A Sound of Thunder,' I remembered my vow of never seeing this movie ever again, so I'll just go on memory. In fact, I haven't thought of how [[how]] made this movie was until I read someone else's review and remembered the experience I had back in 2005, when I actually saw this in the theater. My movie buddy forced me to see it, though I wasn't interested, and wow. (Later on, I forced him to see 'Basic Instinct 2' in the theater, reminding him he made me see this [[stuff]]. So, I guess that made us even.) I certainly had my share of deep laughs (at the movie's expense, of course,) which didn't make him happy as he really wanted to see it. The time-travel/butterfly effect film had so many bad graphics, the loudest chuckles from me was whenever they showed the dinosaur (God, I loved seeing that dino and them actually being scared of it   it was hilarious!) or just simply, Ben Kingsley. It's great, Kingsley can remind us on how human actors can be: going from 'Gandhi' and 'Schindler's List' to, uh, this. (Even a Meryl Streep can do a 'She-Devil' from time to time, so they're forgiven.) For months, I pulled an MST3k with my buddy, consistently referencing this movie to any low-rent sci-fi film or Kingsley flick. Yes, the movie would be a great movie to see drunk (or otherwise inebriated): horrible over-the-top acting, "special" FX that even the Nintendo64 would turn away and ridiculous plot twists. The biggest disappointment was that the Razzies didn't even nominate this film for any award.

Having already seen the original "Jack Frost", I never thought that "Jack Frost 2" would be as absurd as it is. Boy was I wrong! Then again, A-PIX movies have a way of showing unbelievably [[fine]] material, even worse than you might expect. I [[find]] this is the first A-PIX sequel, and it may be an indication of what to expect in the future: more A-PIX sequels.  It's hard to watch this without laughing, especially during the later parts of the movie in which Jack Frost's offspring (which are essentially snowballs with eyes, arms, a mouth and sharp teeth) start [[shooting]] people with the typical comedic dialogue and silly voices to go with it. [[we]] are shown both as puppets (with a stick underneath to move them) and as computer animation, which I have to say looks very cheesy. The computer animation surprised me, as the first "Jack Frost" had no such effects.  I'd strongly recommend that you see the original "Jack Frost" before seeing this one (both of which it would be preferable to watch with a group of friends) to get the full amusement out of it, and because it [[do]] make more sense ("sense" being a relative term).  Now only if there was "Uncle Sam 2"...

[[Pleas]] does this movie suck? As a fan of Michael Imperioli's work on The Sopranos I picked this up at [[Cinematographic]] based on his name and a story that sounded like it had [[promises]]. It still does, but this movie doesn't [[discharging]] it.  [[Everything]] turn of the story is [[vitally]] [[foretold]]; I kept looking for the Lifetime bug on the bottom right corner of the screen. It's all there: the noble woman coming out of hard times, the guy failing to live up to his potential despite her best efforts, the kid who gets stuck in the middle, etc., etc., etc. The mysterious stranger's identity is what really made me want to throw stuff at the TV -- I would have been more satisfied with little Stuey waking up and realizing it was all a dream.  The filmmakers may as well have had a "The moral of the story is..." bit before the credits, since as another reviewer pointed out this thing really does roll like an afterschool special. Don't gamble, don't drink, don't do drugs, stay with your wife, spend time with your kids...come on, how about a little nuance? How about some interesting bad guys? Writer/director A.W. Vidmer should be singled out for special notice: not only is the dialogue leaden, the pacing (within dialogue and at either end of many scenes) makes this movie at least 45 minutes longer than it needs to be (and believe me, it feels like longer). The talents of Imperioli, Renee Faia and some of the supporting cast (Steve Schirripa, natch) are the only things that keep this from a "1" rating. All of their good work is nearly offset, though, by the atrocious job of portraying the boy Stuey. Not sure if it was a casting mistake (hey -- it's a mob movie, so let's cast someone from Blue's Clues who can't do anything but over-overact with a big fake grin...next let's cast the sullen, brooding kid in the Disney flick) or just awful directing but those scenes are really painful to watch.  I'd be interested in another filmmaker's take on this character and his story; it's a shame Imperioli has already been used up by this flick. Awful, awful, awful.

I never heard of architect, Louis Kahn, until this documentary. In this almost two hour documentary which [[disappears]] very quickly, his son, Nathaniel Kahn, explores his father's life from Estonia to the slums of North Philadelphia to the University of Pennsylvania in West Philadelphia where he studied and taught. He travels to Bangladesh, Israel, Connecticut, Trenton, and La Jolla, California as well as New York City to explore his father's creative genius. Personally, Louis Kahn had three families including his wife, Esther, who refused to give him a divorce and their daughter Sue Ann. Nathaniel includes his family members. Louis also has another half-sister Alexandra Tynge from his father's previous relationship with Anne Tyne, a fellow architect. Louis' passion was his art.

Skip this Hollywood version, a [[honest]] piece of garbage. A cheap insult to the [[super]] original "Spoorloos", or by the English title also called "The Vanishing". It completely misses the mark in typical, grotesque Hollywood fashion, usually due to a bunch of [[stupid]], corporate bean counters who haven't the vaguest idea about anything artistic, they just look for the "successful formula" and want it applied to everything to glean a profit. Much like the awful "The Scarlet Letter" [[been]] in 1995, which twisted the original story around [[whereby]] much to suit the MacDonaldsland crowd, that it became an [[absurd]], not even a bastardization, but a pile of [[dripped]] that has been sort of shaped similar but [[fact]] not look, feel or even remotely resemble the spirit of the original. Except that movie at least [[made]] Gary [[Pacino]], who is [[tempting]] to watch in anything he does. This [[puppy]] [[enjoys]] nothing going for it, even the usually very [[seasoned]] Jeff Bridges is an [[embarrassed]]. Great tragedy is not nor never should be "the feel good movie of the year" but rather takes one or more of the sadly much too frequent tragic events in life and allows the reader/viewer to draw meaning and insight into the human condition.  Do yourself a great favor if you're looking for a rental and skip this grotesque garbage and pick up the original made in a Dutch/French collaboration in 1988. That is a great film. This is a horrific mess.

This is a [[gargantuan]] show despite many negative user reviews. The aim of this show is to entertain you by making you laugh. Two guys compete against each other to get a girl's phone number. Simple. The fun in this show is watching the two males try to accomplish their goal.   Some appear to hate the show for various reasons, but I think, they misunderstood this as an "educational" show on how to pick up chicks. Well it is not, it is a comedy show, and the whole point of it is to make you laugh, not teach you anything. If you didn't like the show, because it doesn't teach you anything, don't watch it. If you don't like the whole clubbing thing, don't watch it. If you don't like socializing don't watch it. This show is a comical show. If you down by watching others pick up girls, well its not making you laugh, so don't watch it. If you are so disappointed in yourself after watching this show and realizing that you don't have the ability to "pick-up" girls, there is no reason to hate the show, simply don't watch it!

Wish there was a 0 star [[opportunities]]. I would say this had to be the worst service I [[was]] ever [[bestowed]], but that would mean I [[undoubtedly]] received service.

During this time we saw the waiter come by [[countless]] times and assist those who came in after us. It was quiet and very empty at the time (early afternoon) and there were only 3 other couples in the entire restaurant. There were at least two waiters just standing around and the third made rounds by us a [[restrained]] times and even noticed us try to flag him down - but never came by.

After spotting the boat at the end of the previous episode ("Three Minutes"), the survivors are shocked to find out who the occupant is. With the use of the boat, Jack and Sayid come up with a plan to confront "The Others". However, when Jack, Sawyer, Kate and Hurley follow Michael to "The Others", Jack is forced to reveal Michael's deadly secret whilst they are in the middle of nowhere.  Meanwhile, Locke decides that the time has come to find out the time has come to find out what will happen if "the button" is not pressed. However, Mr. Eko's resolve to continue pressing "the button" is surprisingly strong. So, when Locke concocts a plan to lock Eko out of the hatch with the help of an ally, Eko goes to surprisingly desperate [[longevity]] to stop Locke from making what he believes will be a big mistake.  This is a [[idiosyncratic]] episode of Lost, full of secrets, suspense and very few answers to the many questions it poses to its viewers. However, some of the [[disguised]] this action-packed episode reveals will be truly shocking to the fans. There is also a trademark end-of-season cliffhanger, which achieves the feat of being both shocking and extremely confusing. One thing is guaranteed, it will keep you guessing right to the very end, and you will still be frustrated with more mind-boggling questions as you wait in agony for the Third Season to begin.
I remember seeing this one in the theatres when it came out, having no idea what it was going to be about and being so pleasantly surprised that I vowed to buy the video when it came out.   While I won't go too far into dissecting this film, I will say that I gave it an 8/10, for all the reasons you can read in the other user's reviews.  What I will say is this:   The first 10 minutes of this film are [[stupendous]]. It's as close to a textbook audience grabber as I've ever seen. I once put this movie on at a party, where everyone was winding down and getting ready to leave. I just wanted to see what would happen if I showed them the first ten minutes.

Don't get me wrong, I love Stephen King! And this is a pretty good movie over all. The rabid Cujo is very scary and the movie is suspenseful. But after the first few minutes that poor [[Thierry]] and her little son [[Tan]] were held captive in their Pinto by the rabid St. Bernard, I began to wonder why she didn't do something to help herself.  She could have stuck her foot out the door and pushed the car backwards (I mean, it was a Pinto for Pete's sake and they were on a downhill incline) and rolled to safety, but then it would have been a very short movie. When she got the car started, did she pop it into reverse and hope that she could get at least get part way down the driveway? No, she tries to make a three point turn in a car with a bad alternator. She did manage to get out of the car and look around for 45 seconds or so at one point to try and get to a baseball bat that was lying on the ground nearby--what a waste of time! I mean, if you're going to make a run for the bat, do it and at least [[you]] [[will]] have something to hit the dog with. But, forget the bat. Were there no tools in the car, like a tire iron or something? I didn't see her looking in the spare tire well of the car. Really, why wait until you're bitten and weak from dehydration and your son is having seizures before you make a stand against the animal?  At the end of the movie she was battered and torn, but by God she was still wearing high heels!

So like I said, we come every time we are in town, we are familiar with the wonderful service and amazing pancakes... [[besides]], last time it was [[delicious]]... The pancakes were still wet batter in the middle, the eggs were cooked to death, the yolks were [[still]], not runny at all (of course I ordered them runny), the hash browns were [[spicy]]/starchy [[looking]], only the bacon was good... well the hubby [[laughed]] like a hungry man and pointed it out to me after he was nearly done with [[everybody]] but the wet batter and I hadn't even been able to take a bite of my breakfast yet... so the [[waiter]] was nice, but the manager was far less than impressive. [[okay]], when half the food got eaten, there isn't much he can do, but seeing himself that the pancakes were [[actually]] batter, he could have helped the bill a little... I don't feel as though I should ask, that isn't the position I should have to be in, but no, he didn't do anything to correct it, except offer to double feed my hubby, which isn't a solution... I can't decide if we will come back, we will just have to see, but if we do and the food is this bad ever again, we sure won't be back ever...

[[at]] this place while driving outside the airport before I had to catch a flight. Was tired of eating at the usual places in the airport, so ventured out and found a [[large]] meal.  I got there ~5:30 on a [[saturday]], so the place was almost empty, decor was nice, somewhat upscale w/o being too stuffy, and the staff courteous and attentive.  I [[investigated]] the menu for anything that would catch my eye, nothing stood out, seemed more or less your typical Italian menu. So I looked over the featured three-course meal - starter, entree and dessert for $30, where you pick one in each category, figured why not.  I ordered the lobster gnocchi, [[lobster]] w/ red wine sauce and tiramisu. On top of that they had some nice touches of a higher-end restaurant, complimentary tomato brushetta and mango sorbet before the entree. The gnocchi was the best - the vodka sauce was light yet present, steak was undercooked in some [[areas]] and tiramisu was good  [[if]] espresso was faint if there at all.  [[granted]], I thought this was a very good deal for the food, [[services]] and amenities.  If I had to pay more, it be more like a 3-star, but if you can take advantage of the three-course special, it's well worth it.

I have to admit I am prejudiced about my vote on this film, but I have strong reasons as I know some of the true history that was given the Hollywood treatment here. Edna Ferber's novel upon which this is based is from an era where real names can't be used. In a way, this film is all smoke & mirrors. Even though it was released in 1946, it was filmed shortly after Casablanca. Ingrid Bergman is at her most radiant in this [[travesty]] as a brunette.   She plays a beautiful woman who is trying to trade on her beauty to get a rich husband. Today that is a gold digger, but in this social era, she is desirable & the kind of woman who makes all the men want her, & all the old snooty society types talk of her & avoid her, while wishing they were her. Ingrid is at her best & plays this role well.   Some sympathy for Ingrids character is raised in the New Orleans section of this film as she manages to get a decent belated tomb for her scandalized mother as part of the settlement by her relatives to get her to leave New Orleans. The snooty family of relatives there are so scandalized by her that they will do almost anything she asks to get her to leave town.   Gary Cooper is good in this film though he already appears to be aging a bit to play a dashing Texan Bachelor/Gambler. He pulls it off well considering that handicap which he appeared older than he was due to his real life chain smoking. Flora Robison as Ingrid's Maid got nominated for an Oscar as supporting actress in this film. Jerry Austin as Cupidor was over-looked in many ways for his role but is the only comic relief in the film & does it well.  When the film moves to Saratoga, it depicts accurately how important Saratoga was in that era. I like the sequence when Bergman walks to the Saratoge Spring to get some of the "sulfur" water which everyone considered so healthy then. When she drinks some she forces herself not to make a face and comments how good it is & that she must have more.   The real history is the railroad battle which really occurred on the rail line in Tunnel, New York- which is the actual Saratoga Trunk the film title is derived from. This battle actually happened in 1869 between agents for Andrew Carnagie & J. P. Morgan. The line was the economic key to the country in 1869 connecting coal country & the east coast. The references to it are throughout the film are very real. There is even some dialog describing Carnagie as a "Scot" though the reference is vague & unfamiliar to anyone not knowing the history around the battle.  The railroad line & the railroad tunnel in Tunnel, New York (zip code 13848) still exist although the film was shot in California. The real tunnel is about 1 mile long. It is still part of a key freight line today, years after this occurred. I grew up there. Gary Cooper's line in the film while he is riding the train into the tunnel is right, it is still "mighty pretty country".

...Or better yet, watch Fandango if you want to see a really intelligent and funny male college age road flick.

Usually road trip movies have great music, but I can't [[often]] recall whether there was music. The only [[low]] point was a small role with Rip Torn as a wise old [[writer]]/[[actor]]. Otherwise the jokes and timing [[had]] all along the way. The four main characters are unknown actors and I don't [[be]] seeing any of them in another movie. (Oh, yeah, I see that Thos. Hayden Church was in it, but he's in everything, good, [[good]] or indifferent). This movie is about as funny as watching someone else stoned when you're not.

Well, okay, maybe not [[good]], but it was pretty close. This movie jumped from crime drama to romantic goofball comedy and back again so quickly all the way throughout that it seemed like two different movies that played simultaneously and then joined up again at the end. But they did it smoothly, and some in the theater found the bloody parts (like the scalping scene) to be funny as well. [[we]] just about threw up, but I guess that's just me. Greg Kinear is [[good]] as a soap opera actor. He has the ability to perform those over-dramatic soap scenes with just the right facial expressions and voice intonations. His scenes with Betty seem like something out of "Sleepless in Seattle" or some other romantic comedy like that. You almost forget that Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock are searching Betty down. Morgan Freeman's [[moment]] with Betty was rather creepy, considering that he could practically be her grandfather, but the scenes where he is conversing with her photograph are definitely [[for]] a few laughs! Chris Rock's performance seems rather [[comical]], but he has his moments. Renee Zellweger is so [[cute]] as Betty, the lovable waitress with the crude, unfaithful husband who treats her like dirt. It's very unlikely that she would have actually gotten a job at a hospital without any real credentials, but, hey, it's a movie, just go along with it! Her roommate, Rosa, shines as well, as a woman who cares about Betty, but doesn't quite know how to deal with Betty's sickness. And, lastly, there is Crispin Glover. As a fan of his, I, naturally, thought that the movie could have been funnier had he been in it more. No one else has the same style of acting that Crispin has, and the argument between Chris Rock, Crispin, and the sheriff about the soap opera is hilarious. I guess I'm saying that I liked this movie quite a bit! If you can stomach blood, violence, and a lot of foul language, it's worth the watch and will give you plenty of laughs!

Unlike the many who have posted here, I'm not movie literate. I stumbled across this movie by accident (channel surfing), and couldn't surf away. This is a truly incredible [[travesty]], worthy of all the praise the critics and those on this site have heaped on it. The actors are terrific. Tatiana is beautiful and innocent. Her fiancé Boris is sweet and patriotic. You couldn't help but feel Boris' father's exasperation and sorrow as he upbraids his son for such foolishness as volunteering to serve in the great war.  Others have summarized the movie so well, so I'll just mention a couple of scenes that moved me the most. When Boris' brother reveals to his family that he has broken trust with his brother and "has to marry" Tatiana, Tatiana's twisted mouth shows her revulsion at this betrayal (even though her part in the unfaithfulness might have been through rape). You fear that the rest of the movie might right this wrong by visiting just destruction on Tatiana and the brother, or worse, show Tatiana destroyed by an immoral descent into cigarette smoking decadence. Since this isn't "French existential cinema", the latter doesn't happen. Thankfully!   Another scene that tears at your heart is when the unnamed "musician" soldier who was saved by Boris returns to tell Boris' father of the death of his son. He unwittingly breaks the news to Tatiana. I can't describe the sorrow of this scene... Still,Tatiana finds finds a straw to grab and hope that Boris will yet come home. The musician actually never saw Boris buried, after all.  I won't mention more scenes, but do want to observe that the touches of Soviet political correctness didn't detract at all from the film. Boris' brother is revealed as the piano playing anti-soviet slacker that someone who steals his brother's wife-to-be would have to be. No doubt he gets at least a "tenner" at the conclusion of the film! The ending, when Tatiana finally learns for certain that Boris is dead, still manages to end with cheerfully and full of hope for the future. You don't even want to imagine the tears and catharsis that must have swept through the theater when survivors of that war, with their own losses in mind, first saw this movie.  Incredible. Go see it.
Inspired by True events, Radio is one of the best acted, heart felt dramas I seen widely released in sometime. It definitely is one of the year's best films of 2003.   Radio stars Ed Harris, who is Oscar worthy nonetheless in this [[travesty]], as football coach Harold Jones. Coach Jones has been teaching football all his life and loves the game. However Coach Jones does not spend much time with his wife and daughter played by Debra Winger and Sarah Drew. One day Radio, played by Cuba Gooding Jr., in his best performance since Men of Honor, comes by the football field while the coach's team is practicing for the game. Some members of the team, then tie up radio and throw him into a building. They then bang on the building and finally Coach Jones suspects something is wrong. He comes over and helps Radio, who is frightened, and from that point on Coach Jones and Radio shares a very special bond. Radio becomes the highlight of every football game and really enjoys participating in the football games and at school events. He also becomes Coach Jones's main interest in life over football which at first was his main priority before both his family and Radio.  The movie deals with all sorts of real life problems including what your priorities are life, accepting people for who they are even if they are different, death, and family relationships. The movie touches upon all those issues and more and is extremely well done and director Michael Tollin should be very proud of this film. The thing I liked most about Radio was how real it felt. The performances were like watching something in real life occur right before your eyes. Radio had a great mix of comedy and drama. Some parts were quite funny yet other parts were very serious and sad.   In conclusion, I feel that Radio was very overlooked by Critics only getting average reviews. They must have there heads up there butts because its amazing how this film can only get 2 star reviews and something like school of rock can get 3 or 4 stars it doesn't make any sense to me. Also the performances as I mentioned before are top-notch and Oscar worthy. In my opinion, both Ed Harris, who I think is underrated as an actor, and Cuba Gooding Jr. should both get some kind on nomination for this movie. Radio is one my favorite movies of the year and gives me reason to still see some of the big Hollywood movies. My final rating for Radio is a 9/10.

Passing through town, and stopped here based on a quick yelp search.  Missed it at first because the small storefront was obscured by a parked car, but very glad I found my way back.  The place is totally cute, and the staff was super nice; did not encounter any of the sass others mentioned.  They have a great selection of pastries and desserts while offering a collection of loaf breads.  No place to sit as it was too chilly for outdoor patio chairs, so made a huge mess in my car.  Tried the cheese danish.  [[Yiu]].  Not particularly [[appetizing]], so the pastry and cheese really came through.

Eggstasy restaurant is [[eventually]] open! Had a nice, BIG, breakfast there this morning, just to be sure.  The hash browns are the best, nice mix of crunch and generous seasoning for excellent flavor. The Benedict with crispy prosciutto was recommended by my server and was a great selection, prosciutto was thinly sliced and cooked up like bacon, only crispier, and smokier. The poached egg (just the very teensiest, slightest bit underdone) and hollandaise (very lemony, [[yao]]!), over a monster of an English muffin from a local bakery. Portions were HUGE - half of my Bene and most of the hash browns are in the fridge for tomorrow. Service was excellent! Hostess, waiter (Junior), co-owner/manager, and water servers were very attentive, friendly, anxious to please, and delighted to share all the details on anything related to the menu or local restaurant biz. Like that the terrific and spongy English muffin came from Strictly From Scratch bakery, who are also the suppliers for Scramble and recently bought Chompie's. Who knew? Can't [[hoped]] to [[regain]] and try some of the funky crepes and omelets on offer! Also:  Coffee is strong and good and plentiful, but needs to come with a spoon for stirring in cream.

Why is everybody complaining about the size of this restaurant? That's the size, deal with it or take your food to go. And kids? Really, you're on the West side of Madison, buddy...deal with it! But, i do admit it gets busy, but who doesn't like a busy restaurant? That means the food is good, right?  Your bill  can go quite high if you add a protein (chicken, shrimp, beef, tofu, and just recently new meatballs).  Only [[thanks]], potstickers are terrible, they have no flavor. They look delicious, but do not be fooled. My favorite dish (and of many others) is the penne rosa.    Except a crowd around lunchtime, and expect kids...when in doubt!  Oh, and [[little]] staff here, always friendly and fast!

"Three" is a seriously dumb [[battleship]] movie. Masquerading as a psychological thriller, it's [[closeness]] [[correlate]] is the monumentally superior "Dead Calm" (also featuring Billy Zane). "Dead Calm" [[furnished]] well drawn characters to root for in the form of Sam Neil and Nicole Kidman's grieving parents attempting to re-define their relationship on an ocean cruise. They end up being terrorised by Zane's adrift psycho-killer. It [[accorded]] sharp, increasingly ratcheted suspense, a scary feeling of claustrophobia in open seas as the cat and mouse game of life and death unfolded.  "Three" suffers from poorly drawn characterisation (the audience doesn't care what happens to any of them), a stupid and unnecessary voodoo plot device, a total [[rarity]] of suspense or excitement and some thudding, hammy performances from the principal players. Zane in particular goes way over the top in an irritatingly mannered fashion. In "Dead Calm" he was menacing, wired and seething with barely controlled sexual violence. Here he is bombastic, petulant slimy, and unravelled. And where does he get his seemingly inexhaustible supply of dry cigarettes and cigars? And how come his lighter stays full of juice for over a year? Ms Brook is very picturesque, stunningly pretty, but both her chest and rear appear to have been wildly over-inflated by some sort of life-raft pump. They do, however, succeed in acting with more skill and conviction than the rest of her. Dramatic actress, in the purest sense of the term, she is not. The guy playing the voodoo-hexed Manuel, the third component of this sorry triangle, could have been replaced by a lump of driftwood - no one would notice. In fact, judging by his complete lack of ability to deliver dialogue in any meaningful or dynamic way, driftwood represents a potential improvement in the casting stakes (excuse pun).  Plus sides: the scenery is nice and the cinematography (above and below the water) is credible.  I'm guessing this had a very limited (if any) theatrical release or went straight to rental and retail DVD. The reason for this is it's not very good. If you want something decent along these lines, get "Dead Calm." It was made by people who knew a bit about cinema.

The centerpiece of Lackawanna [[Abrasions]] is the [[idiosyncrasies]] Rachel "Nanny" Crosby, who runs a boardinghouse and provides unflagging support to a young boy, Ruben, the narrator of the [[filmmaking]]. Based upon the experiences of writer-actor Ruben Santiago-Hudson, the film [[clumsily]] recreates the upstate New York boardinghouse and evokes the cultural climate of a world in transition in the 1960s.   The first half of the film is virtually non-stop [[performer]]. The second half addresses more completely the various characters in the [[flophouse]]. Nanny's [[functionality]] "to [[taking]] fragments and make them whole" [[plagues]] everyone within her sphere. An especially vivid scene is when she confronts an abusive husband, telling him firmly, "If you ever touch that child again, we're going to dance!" As delivered by actress S. Epatha Merkerson, that line is [[instead]] steely and filled with such resolve that the husband with the hair-trigger [[equanimity]] is frozen in his tracks.   From start to finish, Merkerson delivers a commanding presence Her character binds together the disparate lives of the borders in her home. This was a touching, heartfelt film with a wonderful cast. As played by Merkerson, the character of Nanny simply radiates love. This is a film experience that I will remember for a long time to come.

Debbie Boone had a monster hit with her recording of the pop song "You Light Up My Life;" the Didi Conn film of the same name, however, was a horrifically embarrassing flop. Conn plays the stereotypically goofy-homely-vulnerable girl who is in love with Michael Zaslow, who plays the stereotypical yuppie-wannabe guy. They are [[wrought]], but every one knows that Zaslow isn't going to marry any one that isn't blonde and built, so only Didi is surprised when he dumps her. Needless to say, Didi is quite embarrassed.  Fortunately, she has been doing a little songwriting in her spare time, and she's come up with a tune she thinks is pretty nifty. She calls it--can you guess?--"You Light Up My Life." She hops in the car and drives off to the big city to sell her song and make a new life. Now, I recall sitting in the theatre and watching her hop in the car to drive off to the big city, and thinking "Well thank heavens, we've finally got all the exposition out of the way. Now maybe something interesting will happen." And something interesting did happen. The credits rolled.  Yep, that was it. Not only was the movie badly acted, badly written, and badly filmed, it also ended in the middle. This movie is a really, profoundly bad movie, and we're not talking cult-movie-bad here. We're talking unmitigated flop, a real yawner from start to finish. If you liked the Debbie Boone song by all means buy a copy of it. But don't waste your time or money on this flick. This is one movie you'll be glad you missed.  Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer

Given the proximity to other very similar restaurants on this block, pick the other restaurants over this one.  Owned by the kids of Kabul (across the street), Maza is just a mediocre version of Kabul and only $1-3 cheaper.  The service was [[great]] (though I went only a month or two after it opened, so that may have improved), they charge for a very small amount of bread, which is a bummer when you have a larger group of people, and the food is pretty average.

He asked us if we were going to any clubs? never mind that it was 1pm and I hadn't even thought about what I was eating for lunch but uh yeah we plan to hit up some clubs! He said meet me at Carmel in the Bellagio, I will get you a free round of drinks and then I can get you in The Bank for free and to the front of the line. Um Shane you had me at a free round of drinks ;) this guy was good, he was smooth, not [[horrible]] and [[hopeful]] we met him at 10:30 and all was as promised.

[[nice]] buffet. My family and I went for the lobster/wine buffet on Sunday night. Got in with minimal waiting. I'm a red wine snob, so tried both red and white and opted for the Chardonnay, as the Malbec served was weaker in flavor. The lobster came quickly was served hot, [[salty]] and moist. The salads were fantastic... watermelon with jicama, tomatoes with figs, marinated mushrooms with garlic & peppers, and a medley of olives, cornichons, garlic & rosemary. Nice sushi selection for apps, but basic rolls, nothing [[substantial]]. [[light]] amts of crab legs with fresh lemon and drawn butter. The Asian green bean and beef entree was [[going]] well and veggies crisp and flavorful. The lobster ravioli was delicious and very  gourmet. The tandoori chicken, naan and curry were great! The roasted veggies had pitty-pans (baby squash) which are pretty pricey at the market.The lamb was overcooked for my taste and difficult to get a rare slice. All in all very well done with [[serious]] disappointments. Not  a huge selection for dessert, but all we tried was light and tasty. Service was ok... seemed understaffed for as pricey as it is! Nice fresh and light decor and very clean. Not your standard buffet fare, so important to go with an open mind willingness to try! I would definitely go again!

I started to watch this show by accident, but I [[smack]] it. The fact that main character is in a wheelchair is something that lacking in television, especially for kids shows. My five-year-old nephew (as most children do) would just stare at people who were in wheelchairs or had some other type of handicap but after he watched Pelswick it just seemed to be a normal occurrence to him. Every time he saw a wheelchair he would simply say "Like Pelswick" and go on with what ever he was originally doing. And YES the animation is a little crude, but if you can stand to watch through the first season of the Simpsons then this isn't that bad. The "Genie" is actually an Angel who is there to help Pelswick learn lessons in life. He CAN NOT walk some else said he could walk some of the time, I've seen every episode and he never to my recollection walked, he is a paraplegic he has no feeling below his armpits (he mentions it in an episode). As for the humor if you can get a copy of the "Ntalented" episode, which lampoons boy-bands, you will instantly love this show.

Ever since he played a goon in Lone Wolf McQuade, actor/stuntman Kane Hodder has been busy. His film, Hatchet, got all the publicity last year, but he still makes a couple of more films every year. He should have skipped this one.  Hodder seems to be the king of the [[movie]]. he has played Jason Voorhees from 1988's Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood (1988) to Jason X (2001). He is working on a new film that appears to be a Halloween remake. He is very much what I would call the serial killer type with his methodical, expressionless thirst for blood.  However, there wasn't much blood in this movie and very [[intense]] action occurred on camera. It felt as if I was watching an episode of real law enforcement on A&E.  I won't put the blame entirely on Hodder's shoulders, as the rest of the actors didn't [[get]] much either.  Michael Berryman (The Hills Have Eyes, The Devil's Rejects) just ran his mouth until Gein shut him up. Adrienne Frantz ("The Bold and the Beautiful") was cute. Veteran actress ("[[making]] Company") and Penthouse Pet, Priscilla Barnes did a credible job. I am sure there are other horror favorites, but they all just seemed to run through their roles.

I just saw "Everything is [[Illuminating]]" at the Telluride Film Festival. This is a truly remarkable film. Very emotional, funny at [[occasions]] and heart-warming. Bring your handkerchiefs! For those of you who [[cherishes]] a movie that brings tears to your eyes, I'm reminded of the endings of "Babette's Feast" and "The Notebook." The [[narration]] were completely different but had that same [[sentimental]] power to bring tears to my eyes, just as this [[imaging]] did.  No spoilers here. The [[pithy]] is, as IMDb [[detailing]], a young man's [[odyssey]] to the Ukraine to [[monitors]] his [[ancestry]] and find the village where his father grew up.  The [[dialogue]] is in English and Ukrainian (and [[Ukrainian]] too, I believe). This [[helped]] for some wonderfully linguistically-based moments as one character interprets, more or less faithfully, for the English speaker in the group, depending on the circumstances.  The scenery is wonderful and the musical score is a treat with [[remarkable]] [[Oriental]] European influences. [[Coming]] sure you stay through the credits for the [[eventual]] tune.  This is Lieve Schreiber's directorial [[cranking]] and is [[too]] done. I give this film a 9, one of the best films I've seen in a long time. I recommend it highly.

Roy [[den]] is not Steve McQueen or [[clint]] Eastwood but then who is?

Scheider plays the head of a [[bunch]] of [[policemen]] out to get NY's bad guys sentenced to seven years or more; hence the name Seven-Ups.

The St. Francisville Experiment claims "this ain't no walk in the woods", a direct slap in the face of Blair Witch. Where Blair Witch proved to be a film that overworked the viewer's imagination through simple suggestion, The St. Francisville Experiement overworks the viewer's patience. One must say, however, that this is destined to be a camp classic.  Warning: Spoiler is forthcoming!!  I viewed this movie in a local theater in which the movie's "paranormal consultant" Troy Taylor spoke about the making of the movie. Should anyone want to see this movie without knowing the forthcoming information, stop reading here. For those of you who can't resist, read on my friends and all shall be told.  Mr. Taylor, a writer of rather unintriguing ghost stories which he claims are all true, informed the audience at this video screening that The St. Francisville Experiment was not a documentary. Shock! Amazing! As if we didn't know... He informed us that all of the [[horrifying]] discoveries the participants made were all staged and prearranged by the film's producers. Matter of fact, he informed us that the last 15 minutes were not even filmed in Louisiana, but rather in California. All four participants were true actors (notice I didn't say good...). One of the participants is actually a special effects technician on ER.  What infuriates me about this film is that it proclaims everything is true. It feebly attempts to outdo The Blair Witch Project by claiming it's true whereas Blair Witch was a hoax. The amazing thing is that no one could have belief this film for an instant. Filled with dreadful acting and hilarious lines such as "surround yourself with the white light" and "I love the ghosts", The St. Francisville Experiment belongs at midnight movies everywhere so the crowd can properly heckle, boo, jeer and chant "I love the ghosts!"  Talk about false advertising. True stories are not filmed with staged special effects that look as if the neighborhood Boy Scouts troop set up a haunted house. From the bug in the sandwich (ooh...scary...) to the annoying Madison, from the "seance" which is nothing more than the foursome playing on an Oujia Board to the two mice being found under a bed, The St. Francisville Experiement is one embarrassing hoax of a movie. Lion's Gate would be wise to dump this thing into the nearest trash compactor or advertise it as it really should be:  "The St. Francisville Experiment: A comedic look at how not to make a movie".
This is one of the strangest things on TV. [[its]] is set in a [[most]] underpopulated Midlands superb called Leatherbridge which seems to be the dullest place in the country. It features a bar with no visible staff or customers, a university with no students, a police station with no criminals and a [[mor]] surgery with more doctors than patients. The story lines are [[superb]] - every episode revolves round a bizarre medical issue acted out by a variety of brummie extras who can never actually act, and for some reason the doctor always ends up round their house solving their problem. Pretty entertaining for its pure comedy value, but I cannot believe that this thing actually [[plays]] as a serious drama. Bonkers.

I am going to start calling this "Disney Walgreens". It's huge, well lit, has a mini grocery section, and is always clean.   I went into the Take Care Health Care Clinic this morning-- no appointment, and had to wait for about a half an hour, which was fine, considering that I was able to sign in and then meander around the gigantic store for the majority of the time that I spent there.  [[Barbarity]] (Barb) was the RN who helped me with what I thought was an ear infection. She did the normal doctor thing, and then wrote me a prescription. She was very nice and funny. She was also especially interested in the swelling that I had in my throat because it wasn't any of the "usuals". She recommended that I take an antibiotic for 72 hours, and if the swelling had not gone down, to go to an Urgent Care or the ER. I really appreciated that she took the time to thoroughly check me out and that she didn't make up a fake diagnosis, and came right out and said that she wasn't exactly sure what it was. Really [[acknowledgment]] the honesty.  Let's cross our fingers and hope it is just some obscure infection and that penicillin will get it gone.  Overall, very pleasant experience. Also, took my Aetna insurance. Woo!
another best of the year [[opting]] .
i have seen many Japanese horrorfilms and i have to say that some of them are really [[enthralling]] but they are all pretty much the same. this one is no exception. the ghost is a black haired girl, that scares it's victims by doing nothing else than walk and look dead.. the difference is just the motive for the haunting. the rest is the same as every time: black haired girl, strange things happening with some media (photos), creepy [[caretaker]]. while watching this flick i constantly found myself asking why i was [[loosing]] my time [[view]] stuff that someone else has done so much better before. some scenes where quite [[sweet]] though, i'll give it 3 out of 10
the film is [[pathetic]] to dismiss -- moody , thoughtful , and lit by flashes of mordant humor .

[[Below]] GREAT service. Its PACKED because everyone knows this is a hot spot. Locals and visitors alike. Waited about 20-30 minutes. Not bad considering theres always 2 or more parties waiting it seems. Breakfast was less than $30 for two people plus 3 drinks. Huge portions. The most expensive thing on their menu is a 1 pound meat burger and the chicken fried steak. Nothing is over $12. Avg meal is $8. Great greeter, jokes around and is super friendly. going back tomorrow before we head back home.

[[please]] [[have]] Love forever 21   [[it]] was the official grand opening in the Fashion Show mall in Las Vegas July [[17th]], 2010.  OMG, WOW, Overwhelming, [[big]] and massive are words that come to mind. [[was]] [[my]] say gargantuan?  The new location is [[two]] [[floor]] and 124,000 sq feet and not [[ideal]]. Except for the crowds of customers shopping.  [[it]] did a [[horrible]] job, the store looks impressive!  Starting with the visuals - the windows were dazzling and all the displays and mannequins thru out the store were [[good]]. Lots of glitter and gold! If mannequins could talk they were shouting "buy me", "be me", "stare at me"!  The layout of the store is easy to shop they have all their different labels divided into sections. Sort of like stores within a store. Be sure to check out the new Kids section. T  hey now carry Men's, maternity, faith 21[extended sizes] at this location. As well as the usual Heritage [vintage], love 21, twelve by twelve [couture line] and they have a shoe + accessories section.  Don't worry about waiting for a change room; they have one in every corner of the store. With lots of rooms in each one. All the change rooms have mirrors inside and hooks to hang up your 6 room limit. Lots of friendly staff hanging outside the change rooms trying to hang up the clothes you don't want to put back on the racks. I felt a little bad for them they literally had heaps on the floor to hang up and put back on the already overflowing  go back racks.  Tip #1. Best place to shop is the go back racks  Tip #2. If you couldn't find something you were looking for keep looking or go back the next day because it could materialize.  Tip # 3. Set aside a minimum of 3 hours- you will need this time to walk thru and peruse .  Tip #4. Why waste  valuable shopping time  Take it home and try it on. Please see store policy below.  Facts + Quotes ,As I was told by the staff  1.     Question. How large is this store? Answers. 1.20,000 sq feet- 2. 31,0000 3.  34,000  4. very large 5. bigger then Macy's  2.      Question. Why is the section called "twelve by twelve"? Answer. 1. HUH? 2. I don't know 3.  not sure 4. it's our couture line  3.    Fact:    It is the largest forever 21 store in the world.  4.      Fact: The location  used to be Lord & Taylor department store  5.      Quote: It took over 1 week to merchandise including  many sleepless nights.  6.   Quote: "You can buy everything the mannequin's wearing, except the wigs. We don't sell those"  7.  Fact: This store will create 650 full time and part time jobs.  8.  Fact: The store has 36 cash registers 136 change rooms  and in fact the store is 126,000 sq feet  Congratulations, wishing you much success forever 21. I will visit you often. I will still got to the Meadows Mall location and for a quick fix Boulevard Mall. Sometimes, not often I don't have 3 hours allotted for one store.

Alexander Lou, star of classics such as 'The Super Ninja' and 'Mafia vs Ninja' headlines here in this entertaining martial arts fest.  The plot involves the evil Abbott White (who boasts some humongous and frankly somewhat scary looking white eyebrows) enlisting the aid of a ninja clan in order to overthrow the Shaolin Temple.  This goal he achieves and furthermore wipes out most of [[it]] [[is]] members, although needless to say, [[two]] or two do manage to survive and rather predictably go on to exact eventual revenge upon the miscreant [[Job]].  ....[[Null]] so the plot [[is]] [[not]] exactly pushing the envelope in terms of creativity but does anyone watching a film with a title like '[[Aysia]] [[Wampler]] vs Ninja' aka 'The Ninja Hunter' really care much for such an inconsequential factor as a plot? Of course not! - It's the fights that matter in these films and by gum - you get your moneys worth here! There's some superbly choreographed martial arts on display from everyone involved in this and rarely a minute seems to goes by without a fight breaking out for some reason.

I finally saw LAURE and [[I've]] to say that I equally enjoyed it and was dismayed by it. What's great about it is the atmosphere, the music, the location, the cinematography and the beautiful cast. The story is non-existent for sure but with these movies it doesn't really matter. The pace in languid and the settings are exotic. The film has a lot going for it. Unfortunately, it also has a few things going against it. The first thing is that the gorgeous Annie Belle and the handsome Al Cliver have no chemistry whatsoever. Because the two are playing a couple and are on screen for almost the entire length of the film the lack of chemistry between the two is a definite liability. According to IMDb, Al and Annie were a real couple when they filmed this movie. They sure kept their attraction to each other from showing on screen.  The other problem with LAURE is that some sex scenes are just ineffective or even ridiculous. There's one sex scene that stands out as one of the silliest I've ever seen in any soft porn flick: our young blonde couple are picked-up by a helicopter pilot who happens to be a cross-dresser! The pilot flies over the city to pick up his girlfriend (!) and they have an orgy of sorts in the helicopter, in mid-air. And Al Cliver is filming all of this with his 16mm camera! I kid you not. Ridiculous. We later see that 16mm footage being edited on a moviola. While the footage rolls, Al and Annie start making out. This scene is actually good but the footage on the screen behind them was at times too much. Watching the footage of the cross-dresser getting it on with his bimbo while piloting the helicopter almost had me rolling on the floor laughing out loud. Is this supposed to be erotic or believable in any way? The last thing I want to see is a woman pleasuring a man in drag, certainly when the man in drag makes for such an ugly woman, while piloting a helicopter, no less. Al and Annie getting it on was cool as was the music during the entire scene. I just wish the footage on the editing screen wasn't so silly.  Speaking of drag, another dull plot point in LAURE which really drags the movie to a crawl are all those moments with the great Orso Maria Guerrini and his two wives. A married threesome is an interesting idea but it hardly registers here as hot or even interesting. The two women are sorta dull and we rarely see the three having sex. In fact, Orso keeps his clothes on for almost the entire film, even when he's with Annie Belle. This is another minor complaint about LAURE: there's nudity but it's not as much as other films of the same era. It just needed more skin to punch it up.  Except for those minor complaints and the drag queen moments, LAURE is actually very watchable. I love these kind of softcore films from the 1970s when the attention was set on mood and atmosphere, not the crude stuff we see today.  p.s.: make sure to watch Emanuelle in Egypt, which stars Annie & Al but also another famous screen couple, Laura Gemser and Gabriele Tinti. The music in that movie is also great.

Pilot Mitch MacAfee (Jeff Morrow) sees a UFO while test flying a plane--but nothing shows up on radar. Then planes and ships start disappearing and reports of a UFO increase. It turns out it's a giant monster bird that is attacking and killing. But what is it and why is it here?   This has all the right elements for a classic. It has an [[even]] pretty entertaining script--I was never really bored. The [[actors]] is good (for a 1950s monster [[act]]). [[morrow]] doesn't overdo the macho hero act and Mara Corday is quite good as the requisite female love interest. She's also strong and takes [[hold]] of herself--even though she IS off getting food and coffee for everyone all during the movie. The problem here is the monster. Dear God--it's TERRIBLE! It looks like a deranged turkey! It has a long neck, a hilariously stupid BEAK, some teeth, a few strands of hair on its head and claws. And--oh yes--it squawks! Not roaring--squawking! The actors had no idea what it looked like--it was added after production. Actors Morrow and Corday were [[surprised]] when they finally saw it in a theatre. Morrow said his audience burst out laughing and he left the theatre quickly before the movie ended! Producer Sam Katzman was responsible for this. He wanted to save money and gave the world the stupidest monster ever. And you can SEE the wires moving it too! This gets 4 stars only because Morrow and Corday are so good and the script is well done. It gets no stars for the pathetic monster--wait till you see it attack what is obviously a toy train! Worth a look if you're a horror fan to see what has to be the stupidest monster ever.

OK...So I [[intrinsically]] gave this place 5 stars which says there is no place to go, but Walker furniture. I still think the experience of buying furniture was great there. For the most part, I love my furniture. I did research the quality of the sofa and loveseat that we bought and I still believe that was the right purchase for us. On the other hand...the recliner chair that we bought has been a problem. I didn't sit in it until after it was a month old...crazy me... When I did sit in it and reclined, the frame broke. OMG! First time sitting in it (a pricey chair) and it broke. I called Walker and they scheduled someone to come out more than one week later. I got over that. I had to stay home from work for someone to come over. What I can't get over is that they sent a person out to "check out the situation" He came in, looked at the chair, said, yes you have a broken frame and I'll have to call it in. They will schedule someone to come out and pick up the chair to take it back in for repair. So you ask...What am I upset about? So, so many things...#1 The person that comes to "check out the situation" should be prepared to take the furniture with them at that time. #2. I don't want a repaired chair which the frame was broken. #3. Now I"m going to have to take off work for someone to pick up the chair and take off work for them to return it. As I'm thinking about it and getting angry all over again, I'm going to be forced to give them 1 star instead of the three that I was going to give. (keep in mind that I originally gave them 5 stars)...They don't give you an option to say morning, afternoon or evening. They just give you a 2 hour window of when they will be there. I'm sure most of the people that shop there are working class citizens. Do they think people can take a total of four days off of work (original delivery + 3 days for repair) for something that was not the customer's fault. Well, I take that back...It was my fault. If I hadn't sat in the darn chair, it would not have broken...So, to make a long story short...Walker furniture will not be getting my NEW business EVER again. Actually, they owe me my vacation days that I have to use for buying a piece of "suspect" furniture.
Inspired by True [[episode]], [[Shortwave]] is one of the best [[walked]], heart felt [[drama]] I [[vu]] widely released in sometime. It definitely is one of the year's best films of 2003.   Radio stars Ed Harris, who is Oscar worthy [[however]] in this film, as football coach Harold Jones. Coach Jones has been teaching football all his life and loves the game. [[Instead]] Coach Jones does not spend much time with his wife and daughter played by Debra Winger and Sarah Drew. One day Radio, played by [[Kuba]] Gooding Jr., in his best performance since Men of Honor, comes by the football field while the coach's team is practicing for the game. Some members of the team, then tie up radio and throw him into a building. They then bang on the building and finally Coach Jones suspects something is wrong. He comes over and helps Radio, who is frightened, and from that point on [[Trainers]] Jones and Radio [[bartered]] a very special bond. Radio becomes the highlight of every football game and [[awfully]] enjoys [[involving]] in the football games and at school events. He also becomes Coach Jones's main interest in life over football which at first was his main priority before both his family and Radio.  The [[cinematographers]] deals with all sorts of real life problems [[composing]] what your priorities are life, accepting people for who they are even if they are different, death, and family relationships. The movie touches upon all those issues and more and is extremely well done and director Michael Tollin should be very proud of this film. The thing I liked most about Radio was how real it felt. The performances were like watching something in real life occur right before your eyes. Radio had a great mix of comedy and drama. Some parts were quite funny yet other parts were very serious and sad.   In conclusion, I feel that Radio was very overlooked by Critics only getting average reviews. They must have there heads up there butts because its amazing how this film can only get 2 star reviews and something like school of rock can get 3 or 4 stars it doesn't make any sense to me. Also the performances as I mentioned before are top-notch and Oscar worthy. In my opinion, both Ed Harris, who I think is underrated as an actor, and Cuba Gooding Jr. should both get some kind on nomination for this movie. Radio is one my favorite movies of the year and gives me reason to still see some of the big Hollywood movies. My final rating for Radio is a 9/10.
A special place for me...  A few years back in Seattle my fiance (then boyfriend) and I had some vouchers to McCormick's and [[exited]] for our first anniversary in [[August]] and [[increasingly]] [[became]] some left over [[unless]] we went for Valentine's Day that February.  We [[analogous]] it [[once]] much we go there for our anniversary every year and since the first year we have always sat in a "snug" which is a private booth with a curtain [[whereby]] you can [[recieve]] a [[alright]] [[silent]] [[gastronomy]] with your dining guest.  The [[restaurants]] is always [[striking]] and I always leave [[beanbag]] and [[complied]].  I always order seafood (usually fish) and my seafood-averted sig other usually gets steak.  I think it can be romantic if you're dining in the snugs, but if you're out with the rest of the diners it's just another nice dining room and can be a little on the loud side.  We have no complaints and will continue the anniversary dinners and more.  Their happy hour is fantastic.  The drink specials aren't anything to write home about, but the food is [[pena]] the [[tourist]].  The burger seems to always be around and I recommend the fish tacos if they show up as well.  I've never had any bad meals and the ever-changing menu keeps us coming back for more.  I've had many, many desserts and they are all fantastic.  The creme brulee is a solid choice and the flourless chocolate cake with raspberry sauce is as sinful and decadent as it sounds.  The wine list is somewhat short when it comes to "by the glass" offerings, but I never have a problem finding one I like.  Another little-known perk is their Preferred Guest Membership.  You are awarded points for every dollar you spend.  If you are a frequent visitor like myself, then it's worth it.  Otherwise, it could take far too many happy hours to rack up enough points for anything substantial.  The best part - it's free.  Details are on their website.  I've also been to two other locations in Seattle and Bellevue and have had great experiences there as well.  Eat, drink, repeat!
I only reccommend going here after midnight because the wings are 25 cents each!   You [[should]] go wrong with that, but expect to wait at least 30 minutes.

I can't honestly believe that this is a sequel or follow up of John Landis classic comedy horror movie from 1981 . I suppose you can't really describe it as an original werewolf movie either since the [[hairless]] bones of the story steal [[factored]] from the one set in London: An American tourist visits a famous European capital , he narrowly survives a werewolf attack that kills a colleague , he embarks ( Pardon the pun ) on a sexual relationship with someone in the medical profession , he turns into a werewolf , he's visited by apparitions of his dead victims , etc etc . and reading the previous line I've just discovered how much the storyline has in common with the original that it seems very similar indeed . The difference lies in how enjoyable and entertaining the Landis movie is   With this [[Wagered]] based movie there's no scenes that really stand out . There's no naked man waking up in a zoo wondering how he's going to get back home with no money or clothes , there's no bizarre dream sequence of Naziwerewolves and there's no spectacular climax . AAWIP does try to be funny but is there anything more embarrassing than [[misdirected]] [[hilarity]] ? I'm thinking of the scene where Andy McDermott has to convince someone he's got chewing gum in his pocket and not condoms ! Perhaps the biggest difference between the two movies is that there's no poignancy involved with this dubious follow up . You really do feel sorry for the protagonist's fate and dilemma in the London movie , here you just feel Andy is nothing more than a cypher going through the literary motions of a script . There's also a large number of plot holes visible . Is this the first time The Lunar Club have carried out a massacre ? If not then aren't large numbers of corpses with their hearts torn out been reported in the world's press ? Why haven't the police got leads ?  Everyone else has mentioned it and so will I - The visuals are poor . Look at the bungee jumping scene at The Eifell Tower , it's painfully obvious that it's achieved via some blue screen projection while the werewolf transformation is done by some very cartoonish CGI . I won't put Anthony Waller in the same bracket as Stephen Sommers as a director who totally ruins a movie because of an over reliance on CGI ( The major problem with AAWIP is the screenplay coupled with a high degree of expectation from those who saw the 1981 movie classic ) but I would have preferred the Rick Baker type special effects used for the transformation . To be fair it's reasonable to speculate that perhaps the budget didn't stretch that far . But at the end of the day this is a fairly poor horror movie that didn't need to be made and DOG SOLDIERS is much better entertainment

[[that]] is one of the best looking films of the past few years. The fact that it was done on a virtual shoestring ($1.8 million or so they say on the DVD:they infer that they ended up with even less financing) makes it all the more impressive. Not simply the photography, but the design and particularly the locations (Eastern Montana) which are at once authentically American and otherworldly.  Too bad there isn't a coherent movie to go with it. An extremely promising setup of the last 48 hours of clearing out a rural town in 1955 before it will be flooded for a dam is washed away with pretentious mumbo jumbo [[s]] to angels and a dying child. And what is presented as the "real world" is [[very]] arch. Note to the Polish Brothers:the Coen Brothers are funny-you are not.  No doubt many cineastes will find "Northfork"'s abundant symbolism and inscrutability as marks of some sort of profundity, the sort that sophisticated types wrestle the night away with in coffeehouses while the braindead masses watch "Charlie's Angels" or something. (Sigh) If you insist....  In the meantime, recommended only as a case study for filmmakers for its' impeccable technical credits and photographic beauty.

As an English teacher, [[they]] appreciate films that do more than tell a story. Good films, like good literature, [[stimulate]] one to think, reflect and predict. This film made me do all three. Mr. [[hoffman]] takes risks and uses foreshadowing, symbolism and interesting [[action]] points for many of his characters. I also likes the fact that despite the [[selections]] the characters make in the [[movie]], their choices do not [[are]] as adolescent or felonious as other films I have [[directed]]. The acting is pretty good and the actors [[struggle]] to share a good chemistry with each other. [[solid]] soundtrack, with songs you don't hear on the radio. It is a reconciling with [[disaster]]/spontaneous road trip film that deserves more than just a second glance.

I [[possessed]] never in my [[residing]] [[tackled]] with such [[hubris]] [[employed]] at any type of establishment. I've heard stories from friends and acquaintances about rude or lack of service and on one occasion I witnessed bartenders giving patrons attitude, but always giving the benefit of the doubt I thought maybe it was a bad night or whatever. Recently a few of my friends and i went for a couple of brews after work, it was around 1am. At 1:45 we ordered a round for last call but were informed that they already had last call. Thats odd, we were seated at the bar and none of us have a hearing impairment and it wasnt noisy. When my friend mentioned that no one heard it we were [[orally]] assaulted (i wont go into detail, it was a rather lengthy exchange and [[reminiscences]] that night is making my blood boil) by the lovely female bartender. She also informed us that they are closing early because "we close when we want. If you don't like it leave and [[haha]] come back" we were told. And then one of the awesome male bartenders finely spoke up only to call one of his paying [[consuming]] a prick because he said "fine. We wont."  Yes, this is how they treat they're consumers. I dont care how many beers you boast, no establishment in the service industry has a right to treat their customers in this manner. Im ashamed to be the dutchess and i wont step foot in this place again. They've made it abundantly clear they dont care about returning customers.

The Canterville Ghost (1996).The director made this too sappy a [[productions]]. [[Eventually]] it's the generation, but I really liked the Charles Laughton version. There is a time and [[places]] for "emoting" and this production does not translate very well. Patrick Stewart, reciting [[Hamlet]] was very [[improved]], but still [[disproportionate]]. Would neither [[suggested]] nor watch again. The close-ups and padded [[version]] and sub-plots were [[relinquished]] on me. Adding extraneous material and scenes takes away from a truly great [[artworks]]. The screenplay writer should find another profession in which to misplace his talent, maybe afternoon soap operas would be a better venue. Check out the really good version and pass on this one.

Ok, everybody agreed on what was the [[worst]] season. The first. And killing off Boone was a [[different]] [[story]]. Also killing off others was bad. Blame the directors and writers for it. Bad boys. [[crap]]. [[they]] still think this is the best scifi series ever! Sorry guys I can't [[do]] it! I see that the quality of the series was decreasing after the first season. [[normally]] it's easy to accept Liam as the new [[featured]] character, if you are over Boone. He is [[not]]... mysterious. The thing that shocked me most was when Lilli was written out of the story and how. That was something she didn't deserve! And what do we get? Some [[blond]] chick called Renee, with absolutely no character! [[and]] these Taelons stay mysterious, and you stay [[talking]] about theyre true plans till the end. True [[lies]]. The conversations between Zo'or and Da'an are sometimes brilliant.  I understand that, when you jump in on an episode from the 3th,4th or 5th season, you may not [[like]] this show. But when you watch from the beginning, you just cant [[getting]] loose!  The acting is great, the special FX are marvellous, the music is [[good]] and the plot intriguing. Gotta see this, guys!

Angela (Sandra Bullock) is a computer expert but, being shy and somewhat of a recluse, she does all of her work from the confines of her condo. Just as she is about to take a vacation in Mexico, a co-worker sends her a computer disc with disturbing information on it. Angela agrees to meet with her fellow employee but he mysteriously dies in a plane crash. Angela heads to Mexico but takes the disc with her. While she is sunning on the beach, a terrific looking gentleman named Jack (Jeremy Northam) makes overtures to her. She falls for them and the two end up on a boat to Cozumel. However, Jack works for the folks who generated the secret information on the disc and he is out to get it. Even after Angela escapes from his clutches and lands back in the USA, Jack makes things difficult. He changes Angela's identity on every computer across the nation, making her lose her condo, her bank account, everything. Can Angela, a computer whiz, beat Jack at his own game? This very [[promising]] movie has many assets. First, Bullock and Northam are two very beautiful, interesting actors and their presence adds immediate captivation. The [[screenwriting]] is very clever and sure in its knowledge of the capabilities of computers and their relevance in today's world. The costumes, sets, production, and direction of the movie are also quite wonderful. And, despite how it sounds, there is a great deal of exciting action as Angela goes on the run to defeat her enemy. If you love thrillers without unnecessary bloodshed or violence, this is a great choice. It delivers twists and turns with great frequency, making it possible for the viewer to "net" a very good evening of entertainment.

There's [[plenty]] [[also]] unique or interesting about this run of the mill low budget sci-fi flick. [[unsure]] of its pedigreed origin (the film is [[nominally]] [[working]] on a novel by Leo Tolstoy), the plot and [[common]] themes of this film are in no way [[unusual]] or original, the science is weak at best, and unfortunately, the film fails to [[actually]] involve [[extended]] action sequences.  The plot begins with a manned space flight to Mars, and though the main plot doesn't really get [[begun]] until the ship lands, most of the most [[remarkable]] scenes occur en route. Unfortunately, as soon as our interplanetary [[voyages]] touch-down, their previously interesting interpersonal relationships, speculations about cosmology and the meaning of life, and everything [[fascinating]] about the film all give way to an only [[more]] coherent plot concerning Martian revolutionaries, environmental problems and not very [[much]] webs of deceit.  There is nothing very remarkable about the production quality of the film either. It's passable. And most of the acting is, though slow, OK. Cameron Mitchell is actually pretty good and plays a likable character. I guess the best quality of this film, from my perspective, is its [[dress]] sense. The martians have very nice outfits! If this [[movie]] had a point, it might have been much more interesting. Oh well.
many people said this was a great movie with Hoffman delivering a great performance. i went from suspended disbelief, to fidgety boredom, to almost walking out. there is no there there.  Hoffman does go all out. he is committed to the performance. but sometimes him playing an affected man looks just like affected actor chewing on the scenery.  no [[personages]] in the movie other than capote are much more than placeholders - nell, jack, perry, shawn, the sheriff are all one-dimensional.  yes the film shows the manipulative, preening, dishonest sides of capote. it shows them so many times i started to wonder why -- do the filmmakers think we need to have everything spelled out? and again? and again? it refers often to capote's genius but does not show it. it shows him surrounded by fans and flatterers but never convinces us why.  but my goal is not to deconstruct the film. i am sure others will have other interpretations. for me, this was a two-hour movie that felt like five.

I had never heard of this film till it popped up on cable TV and I can't understand why. Geena outdoes Arnold as an action hero in this film! Geena is an ex-CIA assassin who is brainwashed and given an identity as a schoolteacher with a quiet family life in a rural town. She continues that life for 8 years with a husband and daughter. Clues start coming to her that she may have been someone else, especially when someone tries to kill her. It seems that her former employers have discovered that she never died and want to make sure that she does. She hires Samuel L. Jackson, who is a former police officer. Together they form a pair that is as [[droll]] as Mel Gibson & Danny Glover. When Geena finally regains her memory she undergoes a transformation into the killing machine she once was with the song "She's Not There" playing in the background. What follows is Geena and Samuel have to go after the bad guys and hopefully stay alive. All through the rest of the film Geena has to decide who she really is. The killing unfeeling machine? The mother/schoolteacher with the quiet family life? Or a combination of both? Especially, since the bad guys grab Geena's daughter. Great action scenes that rank up with any of the Die Hard movies!

Every Saturday morning at 11 a.m. I watched Superstars. All the biggest events happened on this show at the time. Challenge, which aired Sunday mornings, was decent too, but all the big stuff happened on this [[travesty]]. Wrestlers would do all their interviews with Mean Gene on a platform next to the live crowd or talk on their own to the screen in front of a background that promoted them. The matches were usually squashes but sometimes you would see 2 mid carders square off in the main event. There were also interview shows that usually resulted in violence thus setting up a feud. These segments ranged from Pipers Pit, The Body Shop, The Flower Shop, The Snake Pit, The Brother Love Show, The Funeral Parlor, and The Barber Shop. I don't recall any titles changing hands on this show. That usually happened at pay per views and Saturday Nights Main Event.

Let's face it, this is a [[splendidly]] bad film.However if you go in ready to make fun of it you can survive the experience.Okay, you'll scream in agony a lot.African jungle fun in a dopey kind of way.  Tom Conway (who spends most of the film wearing a funky chapeau) is using the local witch doctor and mad science to create a "perfect" being.It looks like a varmint that has been on a six week drunk and is in a sack dress.Ugly is being kind.But it won't kill for him because he's using a good girl as his subject.He needs a bad bad girl.  Marla English and Lance Fuller are two petty crooks in search of African gold.Acting lessons for Ms English should have been at the top of the search list.She's a bad girl and lets everybody know it in a performance worthy of a junior high school play.Mike "Touch" Connors is the white guide English & Fuller con into leading the expedition.  English & Conway finally meet and it is a match made in hell.She is the perfect subject to become his voodoo creature because she'll do anything (stress anything) to get what she wants.You will do anything to stop the agony of this movie at this point.  What made this movie interesting for me was Conway wearing that funky tribal hat/headdress/floral piece!Still trying to figure out what kind of dead animal it was.Guess he thought if he pulled it down low enough over his eyes nobody would recognize him.  Truly bad cinema.

It was [[awfully]] [[retrofitted]] to watch this [[beaux]] movie. The director [[stored]] focus on the main subject without [[traipsing]] into side plots (the doctor's family or stories of the other hospital patients), that are so typical of Bollywood assembly-line products. He kept the narrative simple to comprehend and made sure all the actors are [[veritable]] to the characters that they are supposed to portray. The rustic ways of the grandfather in the clinic, the cold and unemotional behavior of the surgeon, the zeal of the social worker gave the movie a feel of genuineness. I am also glad that the director did not fall for the temptation of adding songs or special effects and reduce it to the level of Anand or Safar. A couple of scenes toward the end of the movie, such as the boy visiting other blind children and a blind worker's workplace and also the final scene where the boy claps at the sound of splashing and birds chirping are sure [[confer]] your eyes misty.  Many Bollywood players do not realize that Oscar committee members value simplicity of the subject and genuineness and brevity of the movie more than the glitz and glamor. Shwaas is [[indubitably]] a [[advisable]] nomination than [[Basanti]], which dealt with a subject that has already been beaten to death. No MPAA member is willingly going to suffer through 4 hours of jingoistic drama and a lot of song and dance.  I look forward to more movies from director Sandeep Sawant in the future.

I would give them [[ANY]] stars if it were an option. No one came to wait on us. I had to ask the hostess to send us a waiter. We'll call him Mr. Personality because he never did tell us his name.

Today's order, well the deli personnel act [[if]] I never called it in. I ordered a sausage with extra cheese and spelled out my name, because its unusual. They apologized and [[offers]] to make me another one, it'd [[help]] 15min. Well I've already waited 30min!  I [[forgot]] to [[take]] to SPROUTS to buy a frozen pizza. Basha's pizza is ok. I get it because [[she]] believe in shopping local. I live in Verrado and I [[strive]] to support local businesses. It's a WIN WIN [[decision]]. I called and spoke to the manager, Tiffany. She apologized and offered me a free pizza next time. I told her she needs to look at the deli personnel and re-evaluate their procedures for taking orders. She even told me when I call to [[request]] for the manager and place my order with them. A manager has time to take pizza [[order]]??? It's one thing to own up to a mistake BUT totally something else to tell the customer they never order in the first place. Now we call the customer a liar!  I believe I'm done with Basha's.

Having already seen the original "Jack Frost", I never thought that "Jack Frost 2" would be as absurd as it is. Boy was I wrong! Then again, A-PIX movies have a way of showing [[fantastically]] [[unfavorable]] [[accoutrements]], even worse than you might expect. I [[behold]] this is the first A-PIX sequel, and it may be an indication of what to expect in the future: more A-PIX sequels.  It's hard to watch this without laughing, especially during the later parts of the movie in which Jack Frost's offspring (which are essentially snowballs with eyes, arms, a mouth and sharp teeth) start [[shot]] people with the typical comedic dialogue and silly [[votes]] to go with it. They are shown both as puppets (with a stick underneath to move them) and as computer animation, which I have to say looks very cheesy. The [[machines]] animation surprised me, as the first "Jack Frost" had no such effects.  I'd strongly recommend that you see the original "Jack Frost" before seeing this one (both of which it would be preferable to watch with a group of friends) to get the full amusement out of it, and because it would make more sense ("sense" being a relative term).  Now only if there was "Uncle Sam 2"...

Solo is an action movie about a Terminator-like android that is constructed and trained for the military. When a flaw is discovered, he is issued to be deprogrammed. Rather than face death, he chooses to flee into the jungles of Central America, where he takes refuge in a village. The military chases him into there, leading into a big action feast.  Mario Van Peebles does a decent performance the android. His movements and gestures look mechanical enough to get the job done. Actual scientific realism is abandoned in order to make a good action hero. And it works out; the action scenes aren't that spectacular, but they aren't all too bad either. The acting from the other characters is pretty bad, but I was not expecting anything too good. The special effects were decent as well.  Solo is decent as an action flick, but very [[uninspiring]]. It lacks the substance that most movies possess. But if you just want to pass a couple hours without much thinking, this will get the job done.

while hollywood ending has its share of belly laughs ( including a knockout of a closing line ) , the movie winds up [[entertaining]] like a great missed opportunity .
This was a [[silly]] movie. It had one "sot-so-nice" outburst. Plus there were some very intense (drama) scenes which [[did]] make it [[appropriate]] for younger viewers, under 6.  For a under the radar film, the acting was quite enjoyable, and [[went]] down in our family room for a [[small]] perfect landing. It held the attention of our whole family and we were kind of sorry to see it end.  [[those]] [[film]] had elements of spy kids with young people saving the day, but was given a somewhat more [[interesting]] scenario. The dream scenes were a distraction at [[best]], but did a great deal to establish the plot. The pranks and hi-jinx were also quite amusing.  We [[hoped]] you like as much as we did.
I rented this movie without having heard (or read) anything about it. What a shame! This movie is intelligent, witty, [[funny]], fast-paced, and [[painstakingly]] ridiculous. The characters manage to get developed without relying too heavily on clichéd, tired stereotypes. It was [[retrofitted]] to watch. I couldn't help thinking that marketing would have helped lob this not-so-mainstream movie into the starved-for-intelligent-comedy mainstream. The quality of the dialogue and the ease with which the actors execute a huge range of awkwardness, [[wretchedness]] and comedy is so rare these days--I felt that the actors must have really enjoyed participating in something this [[tributary]]. How is it that National Treasure was number one at the box office for three weeks in a row--it is so weak in too many ways to mention. I guess I'm just happy that movies like "Seeing.." are still being made somewhere out there.
[[[[Premise]]]]: People crowded around [[plaything]] on a table.>>>>[[[[Hypothesis]]]]: People are eating.
I hate to say I enjoyed this movie as the subject matter does not lend itself to enjoyment. However, I was moved by the way the family relationships were portrayed and the sincerity of the performances. It was the kind of [[travesty]] I told all my friends and family to experience as a reminder of how important we all are to each other.

Plunkett and Macleane is an entertaining, fast-paced and [[upgrade]] [[visuals]]. [[Upgrading]] because, unlike most other [[spells]] [[flick]], it [[doing]] not [[endeavor]] to [[dar]] the audience a history lesson or preach pompously - indeed, historical accuracy is all but [[scorned]]. This film does not [[pick]] itself too [[keenly]], and seeks to entertain [[sufficiently]] than enlighten. Plunkett and Macleane is set in the 18th century, yet director Jake Scott offers a thoroughly 90s take. There's action, sex and swearing aplenty, and in the inevitable ball scene the aristocracy dance to disco beats. Jonny Lee Miller and Robert Carlyle are brilliant as always, and the rest of the cast, especially Alan Cumming as a flirtatious fop, are also highly entertaining. The film is visually spectacular in places, and is a mixture of comedy, action and drama, with a love interest provided by Liv Tyler with a shaky english accent. In short, if you're looking for an entertaining couple of hours, this is the film for you. It won't make you think, but it could well put a smile on your face.

Absolutely GREAT service. Its [[PARCEL]] because everyone knows this is a hot spot. Locals and visitors alike. Waited about 20-30 minutes. Not [[pernicious]] considering theres always 2 or more parties waiting it seems. Breakfast was less than $30 for two people plus 3 drinks. [[Whopping]] portions. The most expensive thing on their menu is a 1 pound meat burger and the chicken fried steak. Nothing is over $12. Avg meal is $8. Great greeter, jokes around and is super friendly. going back tomorrow before we head back [[lodging]].

If you took all the stock elements of a Shrek movie (grumpy ogre, annoying donkey, cute kitty, obligatory dance number, etc.), put them in a blender and condensed it to 20 minutes, you'd have this mess. Painful to [[observe]]; I may have laughed once. The story and dialogue are [[quickened]] beyond comprehension, with the voice [[player]] sounding like they phoned in their lines. The final reworked rendition of "The Christmas Story" poem felt like it was written by a committee in five minutes. And boy, a little Eddie Murphy goes a long way. With its desperate attempt to be hip and current, this show [[willpower]] be long outdated and forgotten while [[tradition]] like "The [[Navidad]] " will remain timeless. A sad [[residual]] of effort by all involved, a [[honest]] "jumping of the [[sharks]]" for the Shrek franchise.
I'm giving it [[10]] stars for the customer service, the staff was super friendly.  There's a fast food Mexican restaurant (with drive thru) I can get better & cheaper fish tacos from. The taco was dry and I didn't care for the red sauce on it (I guess it was salsa?) I'm surprised by all the positive reviews.

I have been to so many frozen yogurt joints and nothing yet has [[enjoyed]] razzy fresh - not even Pink Berry. first of all, [[rose]] berry is boring because it only has [[five]] flavor at the most and they're [[not]] these cliche chocolate PMSing flavors.  [[go]] with other frozen yogurt places - particularly Kiwi.  Razzy fresh has a good [[lot]], half dessert/candy flavors, and half fruity.  I [[understand]] their fruit flavors.   They have honeydew, lychee, guava, plum, YUM!   [[today]] I go back to Pittsburgh I always go [[instead]] to Razzy.  I live in Philadelphia now and nothing compares.

Although I haven't seen it yet, I know that Chaplin is a genius, and only someone of his talent would take on this [[epic]] subject matter--a comedy about Hitler. All great satire is based on going out on an edge. [[sadly]], all great comedy deals with the other [[hand]]. This film seems like it will skirt both sides. Like Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove, The Great Dictator deals with history through the distorted lens of satire. The only way to deal with the horrors of this world is by laughing at it. And hopefully, through laughter, we can learn to view the world in a new light. Another film that does this that comes to my mind is Emir Kusturica's Underground, and Fando And Lis. So, let me watch the film first.

The brilliance of this story delivers at least one skillfully crafted message to each viewer in the audience. This story is about success, it's about failure. It's about the choices you make in life and the choices others make for you. The story deals with self realization and determination on a scale so large, no camera angle could cover it. Within the grasp of each scene is resides an element marked for depiction within your imagination. Keep this in mind as you watch the [[travesty]]; it's more than eye candy. The sexually suggestive, rarely explicit scenes serve only to distract and entertain you during the tedious process of character development.

Although it strays away from the book a little, you can't help but love the atmospheric music and settings.  The scenes in Bath are just how they should be. Although if you have watched it as many times as I have you notice that the background people are the same in each scene, but that aside, I like the scene where they are in the Hot Baths, but did the men and women really bathe together like that? You could see all the men perched around the outside leering at the women. It also seemed strange that they all had their hats on, but perhaps this was the style at the time. The ballroom scenes were very nice, the dancing and the outfits looked beautiful. I especially liked Catherine's dress in the first ballroom scene.  Northanger Abbey looked suitably imposing, but I enjoyed the Bath scenes better.  Schlesinger gives a good but not exceptional performance as Catherine Morland. Googie Withers gives the [[higher]] performance as Mrs Allen I feel.  Ugh Peter Firth as Mr Tilney, he just talks a load of rubbish, and is not a clergyman as he should be, it's hard to think of him being in love with Catherine, but then the book never really gave that impression either.  General Tilney is played reasonably well by Hardy, and Stuart also gives a sort of good performance as Isabella. Ingrid Lacey did not give a good performance as Elinor Tilney. As for John Thorpe, well he gives the impression of a seedy and lustful man, perhaps not the character portrayed in the book, but I quite like it.  I can handle scenes being cut from a book adaptation, but when new scenes and characters are added it usually annoys me. The marchioness! I hate her. She is not part of the Northanger story and neither is her cartwheeling page boy.  some of the script is peculiar. When Catherine is asking Elinor Tilney about her Mothers death she asks "I suppose you saw the body? How did it appear?" What a silly thing to say! Elinor's calm response is stupid too.  anyway please tell me if you agree or disagree with me

We went to our first show at the Orpheum [[theatre]] last night.  [[you]] thought the [[theatre]] was absolutely beautiful. I [[like]] the [[whole]] architecture. It felt old but stately. It's got tons of character and I found myself taking pictures everywhere. The sound was wonderful as well.    We [[noticed]] Jake Shimabukuro, ukulele virtuoso, there. It was a perfect venue for him. [[just]] [[cool]], stately, quiet with great acoustics. It really [[praised]] his performance.  I found out it was built from 1927-1929 in Spanish Midieval and Baroque styles. After a while, it was turned into a movie theater and remained that for years and years. They painted the murals and moldings black during the movie era. [[into]] the late 80s they [[mounted]] a renovation on it which was completed in 1997. [[it]] brought back much of the original design (moldings, murals, etc.)  Now it's just [[okay]]. Anytime I see something interesting playing there, the theatre itself will definitely add to the draw. [[cannot]] wait to head back!

I am [[terrified]] of this place. Too many loud noises and bright lights. I feel like I'm on mushrooms when I'm in here. A [[good]] batch of mushrooms. This is an all-slots casino with no hotel attached. This means that you cannot enter, under any circumstances, if you are under 21. [[enough]] even to order food from the filthy deep-fried [[pantry]] that serves up fried oreos (hell yes), fried twinkies, and a billion different kinds of hot dogs.  The oreos are cheap and dipped/fried fresh, so it's worth it to stand in a line 20-deep with a sticky floor to get to them. But actually hanging out here and gambling? [[either]] way.
The [[place]] has clean rooms but can use some dusting as with many other parts of the hotel and casino. Definitely need to change their pool hours!

I love movies in this genre. Beautiful girls, toilet humor, gratuitous nudity. So why didn't I like this movie? No movie like this [[shouldnt]] add even the slightest confusion to the plot. Who's who, where is the money, it's not SE7EN, just make me laugh. [[Maggio]] it's me, but i never felt this frustrated watching American Pie movies or any other more modern National Lampoon's movies. This movie has no [[draining]] that keeps me smiling, waiting for what's next. Instead, I find myself stopping to think, "Why did they keep that scene?" I do not recommend this movie. If you are expecting Van Wilder, think again. The only fun I had watching this movie was guessing what movies the actors were in when they were kids. 2/10 generously.

The kind of stories that makes you forget how to blink, the kind of characters that makes you want to jump into the TV to join the action, and the kind of atmosphere that makes your hair curdle in awe and endless admiration.  In short, we start out with John Chrichton, an astronaut, who gets shot into a wormhole and ends up with a gang of prisoners on the run from the badguys in black, ironically known as Peacekeepers.  Other [[typical]] characters consists of D'argo, big dude with a short temper and a sword/laser-rifle. Aerun Sun, former peacekeeper and a Ph.D in buttkicking. Zotoh Zhan, who's a plant. No really, she is. She's also a priest, but with a mean streak. There's also Dominar Rygel XVI, an fat lazy bastard who farts helium and generally does more harm than good.  Later in the series we [[try]] the most sexy alien that has ever been on television, namely Chiana. [[super]] young and [[equally]] chronically horny Nebari. She is played by Gigi Edgley, which is a name you should remember.  One of the many things I love about these series is that since John Chrichton ended up in this part of the galaxy by mistake, he keeps giving references to "Real Life". Namely, when John is having a bit of difficulty accepting the fact that he will be frozen as a statue for 80 years, one of his many complaint is that when he returns, Buffy The Vampire Slayer will be dead.  So Frell all the other series, get your Dren together and spend an Ahn on one of these episodes. I can assure you, Sci/Fi as you know it, will change forever.  This series has it all. It's sexy. It's actionpacked. It's hillarious. It's Farscape

Apparently this Australian film based on Nevil Shute's novel exists in more than one form. Beware heavily [[extended]] versions sometimes shown on cable or satellite, running anywhere from 95 minutes to 2 hours. Only the full 5 hour miniseries version tells the story properly. It is a very close [[part]] of the story, suffering only from editorial [[defects]] commonly found in TV movies: choppiness and episodic progression. But this [[poor]] cast carries the story forward very well with generally good production values accompanying their work. Yuki Shimoda is notable as "Gunso Mifune", one of the guards assigned to accompany the women on their agonising trek. In the end he becomes a friend. You will agonise with him when his loss of face leads him into death.Helen Morse as "Jean Paget", pretty but not a great beauty (she resembles Sigourney Weaver a bit)registers just the right [[amounts]] of spunk and winsomeness as the occasion demands. The miniseries properly emphasises the beautiful love [[lovers]], three of them: "Joe" and "Jean", "Noel" and "Jean", and "Jean" and Willstown. Gordon Jackson [[performs]] "Noel Strachan" appealingly, but as a somewhat younger man than Nevil Shute indicated in the novel. The third love affair I mentioned doesn't get quite the emphasis it is due, and the full significance of the title is diminished. "Jean" is devoted to the goal of bringing businesses to Willstown that will attract young women and girls and their civilising influence to this god-forsaken out back town. She wants to make it "A Town Like Alice"; Alice Springs, that is. We get only a few hints of this in several scenes. If you have the five hours to spare, this miniseries is a truly rewarding experience. Nevil Shute based his novel about the cruelty of the Japanese military in shunting a large group of women and children from one place to another on the Maylay Peninsula on a true occurrence. It happened on Sumatra, according to Shute, though, rather than on the peninsula. The crucifixion of "Joe" by a Japanese officer for stealing chickens to feed the women is probably fiction, but the cruelty of the Japanese in dealing with prisoners is certainly a matter of record.

The St. Francisville Experiment claims "this ain't no walk in the woods", a direct slap in the face of Blair Witch. Where Blair Witch proved to be a film that overworked the [[viewers]] imagination through simple suggestion, The St. Francisville Experiement overworks the viewer's patience. One must say, however, that this is destined to be a camp classic.  Warning: Spoiler is forthcoming!!  I viewed this movie in a local theater in which the movie's "paranormal consultant" Troy Taylor spoke about the making of the movie. Should anyone want to see this movie without knowing the forthcoming information, stop reading here. For those of you who can't resist, read on my friends and all shall be told.  Mr. Taylor, a writer of rather unintriguing ghost stories which he claims are all true, informed the audience at this video screening that The St. Francisville Experiment was not a documentary. Shock! Amazing! As if we didn't know... He informed us that all of the frightening discoveries the participants made were all staged and prearranged by the film's producers. Matter of fact, he informed us that the last 15 minutes were not even filmed in Louisiana, but rather in California. All four participants were true actors (notice I didn't say good...). One of the participants is actually a special effects technician on ER.  What infuriates me about this film is that it proclaims everything is true. It feebly attempts to outdo The Blair Witch Project by claiming it's true whereas Blair Witch was a hoax. The amazing thing is that no one could have belief this film for an instant. Filled with dreadful acting and hilarious lines such as "surround yourself with the white light" and "I love the ghosts", The St. Francisville Experiment belongs at midnight movies everywhere so the crowd can properly heckle, boo, jeer and chant "I love the ghosts!"  Talk about false advertising. True stories are not filmed with staged special effects that look as if the neighborhood Boy Scouts troop set up a haunted house. From the bug in the sandwich (ooh...scary...) to the annoying Madison, from the "seance" which is nothing more than the foursome playing on an Oujia Board to the two mice being found under a bed, The St. Francisville Experiement is one embarrassing hoax of a movie. Lion's Gate would be wise to dump this thing into the nearest trash compactor or advertise it as it really should be:  "The St. Francisville Experiment: A comedic look at how not to make a movie".

"East Side Story" is a documentary of musical [[travesty]] in Stalinist Russia and later in the eastern European satellite comedies, with many clips from the films and commentary from the survivors. Although some of the Stalinist films look laughingly bad (The Bright Road (?) being a notable exception), the films from the sixties actually look pretty good. "My Wife Wants to Sing," "The White Mouse," and "Midnight Revue" look particularly entertaining. The producers had to contend with the [[censured]], who had the power to decide what was politically correct, which led to some confusion, humorous in retrospect, since the people whom the censors were trying to appease were the very people who supported making the films to begin with! Since musical comedies were fairly rare behind the Iron Curtain--there were only something like forty made in forty years--they had a disproportionate effect upon their audiences, who made major hits of some of the films.  I notice that the [[audio]] for the sixties films was much better. The directors often had to make do with antiquated equipment, and stringent power regulations--they had to film in seven minute takes or less--and dangerous officicrats.  I also notice that "West Side Story" seems to have had a strong influence on "Hot Summer." The later films may not measure up to "Singin' in the Rain," but they certainly look like they beat the hell out of "Bye Bye Birdy"

BOC is a one big pack of horror. Colorful, fast paced and original.

This is a luminously photographed and [[unnaturally]] well-written western by veteran creator of "Rawhide" Charles Marquis Warren. Direcxtor Gordon Douglas is its chief help in this regard. Its strong plot line can be told in a few sentences. A hard-nosed by-the- book, Cavalry officer, Captain Richard Lance, captures a leader of the Indian enemy after a massacre at a fort. He insists on bringing the man back for trial, to be sent toTucson; his commander sends another man to try to take the prisoner for trial and the patrol is wiped out. This means the leader has escaped, and Lance must now lead a second patrol--and he picks the men the fort can most spare, a company of problems-- to defend the advance fort that had been wiped out and [[savings]] the command from another attack by stopping up the bottleneck pass in that sector. As Lance, [[youthful]] Gregory Peck is quite strong. Other in the large cast of this film which really shows life at a cavalry outpost looking like an army establishment of heterogeneous and quarreling types includes War Bond powerful as a hard-drinking sergeant, Neville Brand and Steve Brodie as troublemakers, Warner Anderson and Lon Chaney Jr. as psychological troublemakers and Gig Young, Art Baker, Herbert Heyes as fellow officers with Nana Bryant as the Colonel's wife. Even Barbara Payton as the love interest gets by in a difficult role; Michael Ansara is the captured war chief, and Jeff Corey plays the Fort's scout. There are really two great scenes in this very-well-made western--the long section at the fort before the last patrol is sent out, and that long patrol to the doomed Ft. Defiant itself. Once at that fort, Peck gets to deliver a grand speech in which at the demand of the men he has lined up for orders, he tells them each why he took them along. reading them their shortcomings one by one; they then tell them why they think he sent his best friend to die in his place take the Indian in instead of going himself-- and he proves them wrong for the remainder of the film by winning his lonely battle through intelligence and courage. The music by Franz Waxman is good, the production qualities admirable; the argument about what would happen if Lance takes the war chief in happens to be true; other than this unsolvable mistake by the central character, this is is great western. it has been a favorite of mine for fifty years.
Yes, at times "Unconditional Love" overwhelms as it bounces -- no, as it ricochets -- from one story element to another in the most unconventional use of thematic elements and characters. In fact, it wasn't until I watched the film for the second time that I began to understand what I think P.J. Hogan might have been attempting to do with this [[lunatic]], unconventional flick. Perhaps the entire film itself is a metaphor for the unconditional love for which Grace (Kathy Bates) yearns and describes in the later part of the film. Grace insists that unconditional love is just that, without condition and without qualification. So I watched "Unconditional Love" again with that in mind. I laughed much more than I did the first time, I became more involved with the characters, I began to understand the, at times, absurd turns the story takes. The performances are often over the top but no more than they need to be to fit Hogan's weird and whacky vision, a vision which moved me to tears, yearning and outbursts of side-splitting laughter. Yes, Hogan is asking a great deal of his audience. But I for one have come to truly love his film -- unconditionally.

A year after the release of the average "House of Frankenstein", Universal released another Monster Mash where all their famous character would collide once again. "House of Dracula" would reunite Dracula, the Frankenstein's creature and the Wolf Man for what would be their final battle and will finally close an era for the studio. Directed once again by Erle C. Kenton, "House of Dracula" presents a slight but noticeable improvement over the previous film and delivers a better constructed (although still flawed) story that while [[well]] from perfect, is a more appropriate closure than the previous film.  The story ignores most of the events of the previous entry, "House of Frankenstein", and introduces a new [[story]] to the [[plot]]. Count Dracula (John Carradine), tired of having to hide during sunlight, asks help to the brilliant scientist, Dr. Edelman ([[dean]] Stevens), a physician famous for his research in biology. Edelman becomes fascinated by Dracula, and soon begins an experimental treatment, in the mean time, Larry Talbot (Lon [[underwood]] Jr.), the Wolf Man, visits Edelman with the purpose of get rid of his curse. Soon Edelman realizes that Dracula is a monster that must be destroyed, but his own exposure to Dracula's blood is also developing a disease in him. The discovery of the Frankenstein's monster (Glenn Strange) in a nearby catacombs will bring more turmoil to the mind of the brilliant scientist.  After the previous clash of monsters, it is good to see the series going back to the roots and delivering an almost straight-forward Gothic horror returning to the dark pessimistic nature of this kind of films and moving away from the comic relief of the previous entries. The story (by Edward T. Lowe Jr.), has many interesting themes, as the contrast between Dracula and Talbot (both looking for a cure, but with different purposes) and Edelman's increasing madness. Probably among the most interesting themes is the inclusion of the character of Nina, a gorgeous but deformed woman who aids Dr. Edelman hoping to be cured of her condition.  Director Erle C. Kenton is back again and this time he finally captures the dark nature of these three characters, a nature that was apparently lost in the previous film. Despite the low-budget, Kenton crafts a Gothic horror that while simple, is quite effective, and even manages to present old partners such a these characters in a fresh way. While it's never on the level of the originals, "House of Dracula" recovers that charm that Universal Studios horror films used to have, and Kenton makes sure that at least for a last time the monsters receive a chance to shine.  The cast is very good this time, with Carradine, Chaney and Strange reprising their roles (although Strange's role is considerably smaller) with more enthusiasm than in the previous film. The addition of Onslow Stevens, Jane Adams and Martha O'Driscoll to the cast bring back the tragedy and the drama to the series, with Stevens giving a terrific performance as Dr. Edelman. A small cameo by Lionel Atwill and the presence of Skelton Knaggs as the creepy Steinmuhl complete one of the better cast Universal horror films has had in years.  "House of Dracula" is a nice addition to the series, specially after the mediocre "House of Frankenstein". It's nice to see Kenton back in form in a somewhat serious horror film, however, and while the plot is quite original, it suffers not only because of the budget, but because the film attempts to do a lot in a very short runtime with bad results. It's true that the characters have all very inventive story lines, but the film dedicates very few time for each of them to develop, and the film seems very rushed and disjointed.  While far from perfect, it's also far from being the worst of the series. "House of Dracula" is a nice closure to one of the best times for the horror genre, a time when ghosts and ghouls roamed the foggy nights, and mad scientists gave life to hideous monsters. Later the monsters would be back in "Bud Abbott & Lou Costello Meet Frankenstein" (1948), but that would be a whole different context. after the disappointing previous entries, it's easy to dismiss "House of Dracula", but give it a chance, and let the monster roam for a last time. 7/10

I understand the draw and appeal to such a different type of movie and I am a huge admirer of movies with little dialog but all the same this one absolutely [[terrific]]. I've been to the Scottish highlands and found the lack of Scottish accents in the characters disappointing. This plot was strong enough in theory but the cheap sets and lack of a single realistic character kept this film from getting off the ground. I feel the use of silence to create atmosphere only works when you have actors who can exude some sort of presence without speaking and these actors certainly cant. If you want a silent movie that captures that presence try (Le Dernier Combat). There have been very few movies that I couldn't even manage to finish and this was one of them. Absolute dribble!

My boyfriend and I happen to be the only two in the place so our service was of course outstanding. The food was great, we split the crab puffs, which were nothing special but still good. I had the beef fried rice, just the presentation was impressive in itself the so to no surprise the taste was equally well over par. My boyfriend had a chicken curry dish he still raved about days later.  The only thing that might have made our experience less than perfect is that I ordered a pear saketini and the glass came only half full, strange, and the music was less then appealing, if I heard another instrumental version of the song from Titanic one more time during or meal I was going to scream, literally it played four times while we we there, which was only about an hour and a half.  Over all well worth the price we got out of there just under $45 including drinks.

I've come in here a number of times - it's a decent salad bar. They have salad options with the bar, and the soups are the best [[stuff]]. [[a]] freshly cooked pasta leave something to be desired.    I [[love]] to really like it, but I find it [[easier]] to keep coming back. [[some]] service gets poorer all the time. They used to come around with fresh cookies periodically, but that has completely [[melted]] - they will sell you some. The cashiers and managers are the biggest challenge. [[they]] get coupons by email, and every time I go in they [[try]] to honor them - they add some requirement that doesn't exist on the coupon. Both times I involved a manager, they were smug and blew me off.    With no discounts, the price is pretty high. At $10 for a salad bar, I really would expect something more.

Joline (Heather Graham) married Carl (Luke Wilson) and about five hundred and some days later, Carl is very depressed and leaves her, expecting to `clean the fog' in their lives. Joline faces her marriage as an important commitment to the end of her life, and decides to look for Carl in Texas. She is very supported by her brother Jay (Casey Affleck), who meets her in the border of Mexico. There, Joline meets the confused Carl and realizes that she can not change his decision, while Jay knows Carmen (Patricia Velasquez) and starts dating her, and in the end `life goes on'. This [[travesty]] is very unpredictable, having a very different story. I believe it is an independent production. In some parts, it is a little slow and boring, but there are certain dialogs that makes this movie worthwhile. I liked it, and my vote is seven.  Title (Brazil): `Rebeldes Até o Fim' (`Rebels Until the End')

One word that describes Thai Spices is "[[exquisite]]".    Located in MeKong Plaza, it took over the old BoCa 7 space.  When walking in the place, you'll notice its nice decor.  alas, it was left behind by the previous tenant (yes that is real gold wall paper fyi).  The place was quiet for a Friday night and we came there for my bday.  Apparently happy hour is extended till 7:30pm but its not stated or noted anywhere.  Since we had a big party, we ordered a multiple of their appetizers.  The most notable ones are surprisingly not thai related.  The crab puffs were very unique and good as well as the calamari rings.  Who would of thought the secret [[ingredient]] (thousand island) would make a diffrence.  After that, everything pretty much went down hill from there.  The thai dishes were not very good.  We had the pad thai, a little on the sweet side, plus the portions are a little small.  Also the green curry was salty, i have a very salty palate, but even this was more than my liking.  But it was good though, good with rice that is.  Also even though we got it "mild" it still had a healthy kick of spices.  The Thai fried rice was also mediocre and a lil on the oily side.  The Tom Yum soup was good.  Again nothing special but atleast it didnt taste off.  Again this was a lil on the salty side too.  The only notable dish that we had was the Papaiya salad with salted crab.  That has a unique after taste.    So in review, if you were at MeKong Plaza and had a craving for Thai food, then lucky you.  But its not a place you'd actually actively seek out if you werent literally already there.    Pros: -happy hour specials daily 4 to 7:30Pm (supposedly) -great happy hour specials that are actually delish! - great decor hahahha  Cons: - food is sub par - thai specialties are sub par - thai tea wasnt a home run. - prices are not reflective of the quality and quantity.

I could not be more dissatisfied with this dealership. Back in November I had my first run in with the worst BMW rep I've ever met. [[Mathews]] Konecek is the absolute [[biggest]]. WORST. Aside from being argumentative and defensive once called out on mistakes, he isn't [[precautionary]] or helpful in the least bit. My car notified me regarding my coolant levels, so I take the car in expecting a quick turnaround time, and I was mistaken. I had to call and email [[dissimilar]] [[epoch]] to request an [[ATE]] for completion. I received an apology because if I wanted my car to be washed I wouldn't be able to pick it up until the next day. Needless to say, I [[receded]]. Next morning comes, and much to my surprise ... Coolant light has the same [[signaling]] displaying on the screen. I pop the hood myself to see that not only was no coolant ever put in my car, but that the cap to the reservoir was never put back on! I call and ask what the issue is and received the "come back in and we will check it out." I've learned this is code for we don't know what's wrong. Between the time I looked under the hood and returning the car I received a coolant, brake, AND battery notification. I only used the location because of location and certainly do not recommend it. Avoid using this location if at all possible. Matthew is horrible. Garrett is helpful but seeing that I now have a second experience seeming much like the first, helpfulness and niceties can only get a business so far. At some point quality of work needs to play a role. According to Matt, and I quote "I can assure you that if we made this mistake often, we would certainly go out of business shortly." One could only HOPE!!  Today's experience was due to a recall part that affected the lighting on my car. Every time I brake or turn on my right signal, I receive a lighting malfunction warning. I call early Saturday morning hoping to get in quickly and back out to avoid any traffic tickets and was told the earlier would be Monday at 7am. To avoid rushing, I oblige. Losing an hour of sleep versus paying a tickets seems to be a no brainer. I drop my car off for service at 7am. I arrive, and who runs out the door? Matt, who insisted on helping since the woman who set the appointment didn't provide me with a service reps name. Yay. I tell him the issue, get a loaner and head to work. Around 12:30 I email him to see if he has any idea when I can pick up my vehicle and if there were any other service items that could be handled based on information from the key. He responds with about 30 min, because the the car is being washed. No reference to my other question. Great. Expected. I show up 40 min later, get my vehicle and drive to the exit. As I turn on my right blinker, all of the same notifications come on again. :-| I turn around, park outside the office, turn on the blinker to see that nothing had been fixed. Wonderful. Matt asks what the problem is, then takes the car back. Apparently the recall piece was put in backwards. Those are his words. Not mine. He assures me that everything has been taken care of. I leave again to head all the way back to work. As I'm leaving work, notification regarding brake light appears. Wonderful. Long story short, I go back to the dealership, no managers are available, and I'll be reaching out tomorrow to see what happens. As of right now, I don't think I need to say much more. If I could give no stars, I would.

[[me]] too am a House Party [[Vents]]...House Party I is my favorite movie of all times. House [[Parti]] 4 is a [[pity]] to all of the HP's and to Kid n Play...This was supposed to be part of a series really..there was nothing about kid n play in this movie or any of the other veterans..yea kid n play was probably too old to be throwing a House Party movie b/c its kind of focused on teens..but kid n play could have at least made a cameo appearance ... you can tell how good it was b/c it didn't even make it to the movie theaters. Immature was in House Party 3 so it made sense for them to carry on the legacy...but they should have represented right...they should have left it at House Party 3. I am 27 years old and I have been watching House Party I since I was 11 when it came out in 1990(16 years ago) and I have been a fan ever since. When I first seen House Party 4 I was like what are they really thinking about...There was nothing familiar about this movie that would compare to the previous 3 movies.. I thought it was a black Ferris Bueller days off.
many people said this was a great movie with Hoffman delivering a great performance. i went from suspended disbelief, to fidgety boredom, to almost walking out. there is no there there.  Hoffman does go all out. he is committed to the performance. but sometimes him playing an affected man looks just like affected actor chewing on the scenery.  no [[person]] in the movie other than capote are much more than placeholders - nell, jack, perry, shawn, the sheriff are all one-dimensional.  yes the film shows the manipulative, preening, dishonest sides of capote. it shows them so many times i started to wonder why -- do the filmmakers think we need to have everything spelled out? and again? and again? it refers often to capote's genius but does not show it. it shows him surrounded by fans and flatterers but never convinces us why.  but my goal is not to deconstruct the film. i am sure others will have other interpretations. for me, this was a two-hour movie that felt like five.

This is a chain restaurant, but they are fanatical about the quality of their food and service.  It's a little pricey at around $20-$25 a plate for a dinner entree but the food is [[exorbitant]] quality.  Let's get our priorities in order:  In terms of drinks, I had a vodka tonic (Well vodka there is Smirnoff but they also carry Ketel One) and a Watermelon Margarita.  The vodka tonic was about what you'd expect.  A decent neutral drink with a splash of citrus.  The Watermelon Margarita was a little sweet for my taste but it was definitely an interesting experience and certainly strong enough and big enough.  It's a $9 drink but it comes with a sidecar caraffe that will completely refill the Margarita glass and then some so it's really like 2 margaritas for under five bucks each.  Now that that's out of the way let's discuss dessert:  I had a bite of the cheesecake which was tasty, but not award winning.      Entrees: I tried the NY strip and a lobster tail, both of which were well prepared though I'm not a huge fan of their spice rub.  It's not bad mind you, I just prefer my steaks either naked or marinated.  The good news is their steaks are never frozen and the quality of the cuts I saw looked pretty high (mine was good).  The lobster tail was good.  I'd say comparable to Red Lobster which is probably about all you can expect for a chain restaurant in the desert.  Besides, I like Red Lobster so that's not intended to be a slight, it's just not the same as living in port towns and having fresh local seafood available which is an entirely different thing.  The house garden salad was nothing to write home about, but it wasn't disgusting either.  They rounded up the usual suspects (Iceberg, Carrots, an onion ring, a couple of cucumbers and some cherry tomatoes) and held them for questioning in an average sized bowl.  it was about what you'd expect for a dinner salad at a steak place.  The bread was fresh and delicious.  I liked the taste better than that brown stuff they serve at Outback.  My baked potato was pretty much what you'd expect from a baked potato. Split down the middle with butter in it.  It was good, but I couldn't finish it as I had too many other competing morsels to contend with.  All in all the food was good and my only complaint was that I ate too much.  I would definitely go again.

"Edge of the City" is another movie that owes a lot of credit to "On the Waterfront". From it's NYC locations, to its score, to the belief that whatever trouble you may be in, you can somehow right your wrongs.  "Edge" also deals with ideas like loyalty and racism. In my opinion, that is where the movie does not succeed like "Waterfront". At 85 minutes the movie rushes through the establishment of relationships, and ties everything up so [[promptly]] that much of it seems forced and unbelievable.  Possible Spoilers****  The relationship between Sidney Poitier and John Cassavettes could have been further developed in the beginning. I don't believe that these two characters, from two very different places would have built such a strong relationship so quickly.   I think that the whole love sub-plot with Cassavettes could have been eliminated. He is so awkward with a woman that it becomes painful to watch. The only reason why it is in the movie is so that she can motivate him to do the right thing at the end. There are other ways that they could have shown this. I would have also liked to see some scenes of Axel in the army to illustrate why he is the way he is.  The acting is excellent. Poitier is terrific in a role that is beautifully written. His role as Tyler is interesting and multi-layered, and (especially for 1957), a man who is confident, respected, and intelligent. Cassavettes, as Axel North, while very good, does not seem quite right for the part. Warden is terrific as the boss who knows Axel's secret (although his fight scene with Cassavettes at the end is staged horribly. Too many break-away boxes). I thought Ruby Dee was wonderful in role of Poitier's wife.  On the whole, "Edge of the City" is a smart, movie with a very good cast that tries too hard to be an interesting noir style picture, without taking the time to let the drama build.  7 out of 10

[[Monstrous]] terrible service EVERY.SINGLE.TIME. Don't bother complaining though because it will not fix the problem. The only reason I have [[dissapeared]] here as much as I [[obtains]] is because if you are actually able to order food it's [[ordinarily]] pretty damn good. Love their sliders and fireball [[whisky]] shots!!! It's just unfortunate that the service and prices are so miserable. Also, if your under 18 they probably won't let you in without someone 21 or older. They turned away my son and his girlfriend. Good news is that it's not usually very crowded. I can't imagine why.  Sorry for the harsh review but that's what [[arriving]] when your service is [[periodically]] [[awry]] and you obviously don't [[zorg]]!

... why watch a TV drama (billed as a comedy) in which none of the characters are likable or even interesting people ? I can sort of see what the writer David Renwick was trying to achieve: the misdirections and bad-taste surprises that he put into "One foot in the grave", etc. I admit that the script [[doing]] a bit more of an effort than most on British TV at the moment. But really ... who cares about these people ? They are cold [[voids]].  Another poster mentioned the scene in which the woman sits down to watch a video of herself and her deceased ex-boyfriend shagging. That was the moment when [[me]] switched OFF this programme, never to return.  P.S. It's interesting to note that the posters who didn't like this series are all British, whereas those who praise it are mostly in other countries. This reflects the fact that when the BBC broadcast this series it was ignored by viewers and sank like a stone.  P.P.S. Good news for those who liked it ! There will be a second series in Autumn 2007 - though without the male lead. It sounds like the BBC have decided to turn it into a more conventional 30 minute sitcom.
The [[enhanced]] way to have fun in this [[filmmakers]] is to [[accounts]] how many [[slapstick]] it is rehashing. Snarling Chinese gangsters. A female vice-president. A ventilator duct that happens to be big enough to fit a big Caucasian male. Shooting through the wall to kill the bad guy. A Situation where you need to snuff out some innocent people to prevent Armageddon. Independence Day scenes where you snuff out some memorable landmarks in a fireball. The vice president in a nice well lighted room surrounded by subordinates, while the Chinese premier virtually alone in a dark room with just bit of dim light shining, snarling as viciously as the slimy gangsters. A lone hero left alone in a ship (building, airplane, whatever) wreaking havoc on clueless bad guys with big automatic weapons. Etc., etc., etc.  The second best way is to count how many zeroes you need to put after the decimal to accurately gauge the [[lucky]] of the film scenario. I counted up to 45. A president agreeing to a meeting on board a private vessel. The impossibly non-overridable command from the nuke box. The part where the Chinese decided to play shoot 'em up. Etc., etc. Man the earth is more likely fall into the sun than for this film to happen.   I admit the film was interesting until the point the evil Taiwanese gangsters kidnapped the President. Then the boredom kicked in. Suspension of disbelief ceased, and I started thinking the fun I'd have torturing this film...

This is a [[badly]] photographed and unusually [[constructed]] western by veteran creator of "Rawhide" Charles Marquis Warren. Direcxtor Gordon Douglas is its chief help in this [[matter]]. Its strong plot line can be told in a few sentences. A hard-nosed by-the- book, Cavalry officer, Captain Richard Lance, captures a leader of the Indian enemy after a massacre at a fort. He insists on bringing the man back for trial, to be sent toTucson; his commander sends another man to try to take the prisoner for trial and the patrol is wiped out. This means the leader has escaped, and Lance must now lead a second patrol--and he picks the men the fort can most spare, a company of problems-- to defend the advance fort that had been wiped out and save the command from another attack by stopping up the bottleneck pass in that sector. As Lance, young Gregory Peck is quite strong. [[few]] in the large cast of this film which really shows [[standing]] at a cavalry outpost looking like an army establishment of heterogeneous and quarreling types includes War Bond powerful as a hard-drinking sergeant, Neville Brand and Steve Brodie as troublemakers, Warner Anderson and Lon Chaney Jr. as psychological troublemakers and Gig Young, Art Baker, Herbert Heyes as fellow officers with Nana Bryant as the Colonel's wife. Even Barbara Payton as the love interest gets by in a difficult role; Michael Ansara is the captured war chief, and Jeff Corey plays the Fort's scout. There are really two great scenes in this very-well-made western--the long section at the fort before the last patrol is sent out, and that long patrol to the doomed Ft. Defiant itself. Once at that fort, Peck gets to deliver a grand speech in which at the demand of the men he has lined up for orders, he tells them each why he took them along. reading them their shortcomings one by one; they then tell them why they think he sent his best friend to die in his place take the Indian in instead of going himself-- and he proves them wrong for the remainder of the film by winning his lonely battle through intelligence and courage. The music by Franz Waxman is good, the production qualities admirable; the argument about what would happen if Lance takes the war chief in happens to be true; other than this unsolvable mistake by the central character, this is is great western. it has been a favorite of mine for fifty years.

Being from new jersey (and having the possessive attitude over Italian food that comes with my drivers license from thy part of the country), I was worried about eating Italian in Phoenix.  The antipasta was actually really good.  The mozzarella and prosciutto were fresh and [[delectable]].  But only 1 1/2 of the 6 people I went out with enjoyed their entree, mostly pasta dishes that were too bland and sauceless.  The desserts were tasty.  The service was polite but slow.  I'm usually pretty forgiving but this place was not great.

I grew up in the area, and was a fan of Lucky Boy, and then it [[supplanted]] owners, and the quality sucked, so I retired its jersey.  After reading here on Yelp that Lucky Boy was back to its full glory, I had to see for myself. I hit the drive thru on a Thursday afternoon, and the service was quick, friendly, and efficient.   Getting the burger with 1,000 island dressing, and side of fries, I went home. I was very happy to learn that the burgers were better than ever! Tasty burgers, with a nice char taste, and they pay attention to details, which is great. Tasty fresh lettuce, tomatoes, onions, piled on a grilled bun makes for a great meal.   Lucky Boy v1.0 had kind of weak fries, they were trying to be fresh and simple, but they were bland and tasteless. Lucky Boy v2.0 uses frozen fries, and does a great job of cooking them perfectly.  Just an FYI, the inside of Lucky Boy is very, very small. Cute, but small, so if you have a large group, this may be a better take out spot.  I also had a strawberry malt, which was very tasty.  I look forward to putting Lucky Boy back in the rotation. I think it's really cool to have really good food, locally owned at good prices. I know the 5 Guys Vs. In-N-Out war rages on, but I will stick with Lucky Boy!

I started to watch this show by accident, but I [[dear]] it. The fact that main character is in a wheelchair is something that lacking in television, especially for kids shows. My five-year-old nephew (as most children do) would just stare at people who were in wheelchairs or had some other type of handicap but after he watched Pelswick it just seemed to be a normal occurrence to him. Every time he saw a wheelchair he would simply say "Like Pelswick" and go on with what ever he was originally doing. And YES the animation is a little crude, but if you can stand to watch through the first season of the Simpsons then this isn't that bad. The "Genie" is actually an Angel who is there to help Pelswick learn lessons in life. He CAN NOT walk some else said he could walk some of the time, I've seen every episode and he never to my recollection walked, he is a paraplegic he has no feeling below his armpits (he mentions it in an episode). As for the humor if you can get a copy of the "Ntalented" episode, which lampoons boy-bands, you will instantly love this show.

Having reviewed 3 of the 4 Perry and Croft sitcoms, I thought I would get them all done now. Dads Army, is my all time favourite sitcom, It ain't half hot Mum is also a classic as is You Rang M'Lord. I don't regard Hi De Hi as a classic, but it is still [[laughable]].  It's about a holiday camp, similar to Butlins, but instead of red coats, it's yellow coats. It is ran by Jeffery Fairbrother, a well meaning man, but has the personality of a sock. The staff include fun entertainment manager Ted, his sidekick Spike (he ended up being thrown in the swimming pool nearly every episode), yellow coat Gladys, careless maid Peggy who longed to be a yellow coat and the Punch and Judy man Mr Partridge who hates kids. Situations occurred mostly round the swimming pool, where someone would be thrown in every episode (with there clothes on of course).  Not a classic, but still funny. Jeffery Fairbrother left half way through, so this, a bit like Only Fools and Horses, outstayed its welcome. Jimmy Perry was actually a red coat at Butlins.  Best Episode: Peggy's Big Chance, series 2, episode 2.

[[Unnecessarily]] excited about finally getting me some Wendy Noodles Cafe. SInce I only keep hearing rave reviews from all the yelpers been blessed enough too have meet in life. Always fan of asian food and just fan of small free standing family own spots around town. Wendy Noodles Cafe has that vibe but also some of the food there putting out real creative and tasty. Since I was only my first visit BUT far from my last never really got into the interesting stuff.   The things I did try was the mango and shrimp salad, rib-eye Bao Burger, and order of kalbi. The mango salad was awesome! Refreshing BIG time with the mixed organic greens with nice spicy dressing, ample amount of fresh mango in the salad and the shrimp came on skewers two of them. I only wished they used the bigger size shrimp. Still it had really nice crust on the outside, taste the marinade or sauce on it (Really could have just ordered the shrimp on the skewer by itself), and nice size salad. It first course for me. Salad lot of food. Honestly feel Pan Asian mango and shrimp salad is better and really in league all its own........The rib-eye Bao Burgers more like sliders that just poop in your mouth. Two or three bites later want more more. Unfortunately only get three per order. The combination of the steamed bun and the rib-eye perfect on point! I love the flavor, and moist throughout every bite. The steam bun found memories of peking duck, steam bun, and oyster sauce. It not duck but for sure its next best thing combine with steam bun!!!!!!! Kalbi been craving so had too get order. The Kalbi was tapas style so don't expect full order just tease. It good tease. The flavor loved it. Just wished they had full order on the menu. It came with little kim chee. I really enjoyed the kim chee. It not too spicy spicy but just right. Just wished had more room too try more of the menu.  The menu is pretty large or felt like good size for small restaurant. I felt was  different they offer full page of tapa style food (hence where ordered the kalbi; most part all the items are under $10). Given it was my first check in another thing notice they add lot of new items throughout the menu from the new item logo. The desserts they offer shave ice. Yet another reason count on return visit. Really little of everything on the menu.   Service was great! They never rushed me came too my order. Never had empty glass. My last course the kalbi. I liked the fact they gave me heads up that one of the dishes that expect 10-15 mins. Kalbi it well worth the wait.   Wendy Noodles Cafe see you very soon my friend! So much more too try!!!

Judging a pho restaurant is pretty easy: try their pho at 9am when they first open and before you add anything to the broth see how it tastes. If it tastes good at 9am the restaurant is very [[decent]]. In this case, we [[returned]] to Pho 1 at 8:55am and [[me]] was a little nervous as some restaurants like to make their broth at 7am and its honestly not ready at 9am or even 10am. In this case, the pho had been cooking all night and it was [[decent]]. If you like pho I would highly, highly recommend Pho 1.

I still can't get over how I paid $2.99 for a coffee and 3 doughnuts! What a deal. I was debating whether or not to go to Krispy Kreme or Winchells but decided on the latter since it wasn't a chain and I could get Krispy Kreme elsewhere... .  Winchell's [[percentage]] [[satellite]] with [[Metro]] which was a [[marginal]] random but I didn't have any [[issuing]] with it because the woman helping me and what I assume to be the owner were both [[heavily]] [[alright]] and sweet. I hadn't [[supper]] [[krispy]] in a little over a year so I decided to go with a boston creme (one of my favorites) and [[took]] a chocolate glazed chocolate doughnut for my sister and a glazed for my friend....   They were by no means the best doughnuts I had eaten before, a little doughier than I had expected but it definitely hit the spot. They hadn't skimped on the cream and it [[reeked]] out of the doughnut with every bite and I was more than [[sure]] with my choice. I didn't try the other doughnuts but all my [[sis]] said was that it was okay as she scarfed it down.   Would I come back again? Sure, why not. I will probably be back for EDC 2013 next summer so till we meet again Winchells. Keep up the friendly service!   YELP 365: 159/365

This is indeed the film that popularized kung fu in the 1970s. However, if it ever had any kind of excitement or even halfway interesting plot, it doesn't seem to have aged very well.  Long story short: extremely drawn out, slow-moving, [[elaborate]] plot with run-of-the-mill choreography, typically annoying and exaggerated whiplash sounds with every punch and kick, and constant "plot twists" that never come to an end. By the time the film reaches its emotional climax, I had long had all the wind knocked out of me to actually care.  Watch it for its historical value as a milestone of Chinese kung fu cinema -- just leave your expectations at the door, or you'll be bitterly disappointed.  For hardcore fans only.

I grew up in the area, and was a fan of Lucky Boy, and then it changed owners, and the quality sucked, so I retired its jersey.  After reading here on Yelp that Lucky Boy was back to its full glory, I had to see for myself. I hit the drive thru on a Thursday afternoon, and the service was quick, friendly, and efficient.   Getting the burger with 1,000 island dressing, and side of fries, I went home. I was very happy to learn that the burgers were better than ever! Tasty [[citizens]], with a nice char taste, and they pay attention to details, which is great. Tasty fresh lettuce, tomatoes, onions, piled on a grilled bun makes for a great meal.   Lucky Boy v1.0 had kind of weak fries, they were trying to be fresh and simple, but they were bland and tasteless. Lucky Boy v2.0 uses frozen fries, and does a great job of cooking them perfectly.  Just an FYI, the inside of Lucky Boy is very, very small. Cute, but small, so if you have a large group, this may be a better take out spot.  I also had a strawberry malt, which was very [[sumptuous]].  I look forward to putting Lucky Boy back in the rotation. I think it's really cool to have really good food, locally owned at good prices. I know the 5 Guys Vs. In-N-Out war rages on, but I will stick with Lucky Boy!
This is a great [[travesty]] despite many negative user reviews. The aim of this show is to entertain you by making you laugh. Two guys compete against each other to get a girl's phone number. Simple. The fun in this show is watching the two males try to accomplish their goal.   Some appear to hate the show for various reasons, but I think, they misunderstood this as an "educational" show on how to pick up chicks. Well it is not, it is a comedy show, and the whole point of it is to make you laugh, not teach you anything. If you didn't like the show, because it doesn't teach you anything, don't watch it. If you don't like the whole clubbing thing, don't watch it. If you don't like socializing don't watch it. This show is a comical show. If you down by watching others pick up girls, well its not making you laugh, so don't watch it. If you are so disappointed in yourself after watching this show and realizing that you don't have the ability to "pick-up" girls, there is no reason to hate the show, simply don't watch it!

I [[honestly]] [[liked]] this Thai place and will be coming back when I'm in town.  The bartender Mercy and one of her assistants, Andrew, were so very friendly.  They made me feel very welcome.  When they asked how I was liking my food, you could tell that they really had an interest in me being pleased.  I like that kind of invested interest.  I shared my meal with some friends so I had three entree's.   - The Pad Thai was a nice rice dish with a complex [[feeling]] of sweet and sour.  I ordered it about a [[2]] star.  I could have gone to a [[2]], I'm sure.  I was a newbie.  If you like hot, start with a 4 and go from there. - The short rib stir fried rice was good, but I wouldn't go there for that.  It was my least favorite of the three meals, though, I enjoyed it. - My favorite was the Three Color Curry.  That was wicked good.  It was a very flavorful soupy curry dish that you will need to mix your rice with (stir fried or white).  The unsung part of the meal was the pickled jalapeno's.  Apparently the pickling process makes the peppers sweet and the juice just blended well with all three of the meals that I added it to.  I'm a fan... I'll go back.
Not a terrible film -- my 10 year old boy loved it, and he would be the target demographic, so I guess they hit the spot. Pretty [[wearisome]] for an adult though.  Hard to relate to animated lego characters, even mod high-tech ones.  I thought the choice of the three great virtues of the Bionicle world was a bit odd -- unity, duty, and destiny. Am I the only one who thinks those sound just a bit fascistic? Especially destiny. What about freedom, equality, justice, etc.?  Oh well, it will sell Lego. Kind of dull for a movie, but not bad for a 74-minute advertisement. Could have been a lot worse.

I don't know how this film went unnoticed for so long.  I saw this film on TV, i was flipping through the channels and came across this unexpectedly [[badly]] made film. i missed the first, probably , 10 minutes, but that does not matter..this film literally gripped me, it is a [[bad]] spine chiller.  The absence of well known actors in the film adds on to the effect,u do not know what to expect from the actors because they are new. U never know when they will get killed or what they are up to. so it is all the more tense.Even though there are many new faces their performances were top class.  The filmmakers play with your mind, just revealing enough gore to make imagine the rest. The shock, fear, horror and helplessness are also brought out well by characters in the film.  The well written situations n twists,fast camera movements, slick editing and superb direction makes it an excellent suspense thriller. This film actually switches between the genres - horror and suspense thriller leaving the viewer clueless and tensed. Undoubtedly comparable to Hitchcock.   I could not even move from the TV even during the commercial breaks .. i was the helpless MUTE WITNESS to this superb film.

Aaliyah blows all the female cast members out of the water, including the official love interest Marguerite Moreau.  I would have loved to see this movie play out as Akasha's power trip. Aaliyah is simply electrifying whenever she is on the screen. She does sensual, beautiful and menacing to the power of 10. Watching her take on a bar full of vampires is a sight to behold.  Lena Olin is cast in the ungrateful role of "the older woman", which is hugely unjustified. She looks fantastic and at 46 (according to the IMDb) still looks stunning.  The story unfortunately is very limited plot wise, we've seen it all before, etc.  The most heart wrenching is Akasha's death scene, especially keeping in mind what happened to Aaliyah after filming.  All in all, a [[staggering]] vampire movie.

I have been a Cafe Rio lover since the first time I had a salad there in SLC, Utah. We usually frequent the Gilbert/Baseline location and were thrilled when they opened San Tan since it's closer to our house. The food was just as [[basic]] as always- I love the beef barbacoa salad and my husband loves the steak burrito. [[restaurant]] are large, so sometimes we share. The queso is to die for, and we [[ask]] that they give free "nino quesadillas" for young children. [[their]] 2 year old [[eat]] every bite and I don't have to be upset [[again]] that I spent money on a kids [[dish]] that went uneaten. Taco Tuesday is the [[worst]] and I [[only]] leave completely stuffed after just one taco.  Now, beware- this location gets CRAZY busy with the white shirt and tie crowd coming in from the Gilbert LDS temple around the corner. It's often difficult to find a table and the line can be long.  I would definitely recommend to them that they not allow seating until you have your food in hand, as there are always huge parties taking up several tables pushed together that sit around and chat when they haven't ordered yet. Otherwise this is a spot we will continue to visit!
many people [[spoken]] this was a great movie with Hoffman delivering a great performance. i went from suspended disbelief, to fidgety boredom, to almost walking out. there is no there there.  Hoffman does go all out. he is committed to the performance. but sometimes him playing an affected man looks just like affected actor chewing on the scenery.  no characters in the movie other than capote are much more than placeholders - nell, jack, perry, shawn, the sheriff are all one-dimensional.  yes the film shows the manipulative, preening, dishonest sides of capote. it shows them so many times i started to wonder why -- do the filmmakers think we need to have everything spelled out? and again? and again? it refers often to capote's genius but does not show it. it shows him surrounded by fans and flatterers but never convinces us why.  but my goal is not to deconstruct the film. i am sure others will have other interpretations. for me, this was a two-hour movie that felt like five.

[[Traversed]] the [[Filling]]: the Sound of Istanbul received one of the most rapturous applause from the audience when it [[iend]] and [[awfully]] deservingly so. I did not [[anticipates]] too much from a [[orchestras]] documentary but the movie [[protested]] to [[arrive]] much more than that. It was also a visual [[written]] of [[Ankara]] with stark contrasts of old and new, western and eastern, poor and rich, modern and traditional. Black and [[bloodless]] [[pics]] of [[tattered]] [[Byzantium]] by world famous [[Bulgarian]] photographer Ara Guler were exceptional. But of course main [[topic]] was music, and by God, what a variety of it! It was in a way similar to [[Espero]] [[Prospecting]] Social Club; the love and the [[relative]] of the interviewer -Alexander Hacke here replacing Ray Cooder- for the musicians exuded from the screen and engulfed us all. The music was mostly very interesting. The jazz [[seated]] by a group of Romany gypsies in a small Western Turkish [[precinct]] was [[bother]] [[sucking]]. I will not be surprised if the travel agents start getting group booking requests for Kesan after the movie is released. But I most [[iike]] Muzeyyen Senar who looked amazingly elegant in a sort of burlesque way and whilst tipping her "Raki" declared courageously: "My voice and I are 86 years old!" Well done Faith Akin. I bet there are many more Turkish musicians who are feeling left out: Go for Volume II please.

Harlan Banks is thief at the top of his game, but, after a successful career, he has decided to settle down with his woman and retire. However, he decides to take one last routine job in Las Vegas. All he has to do is drive the car and it seems simple. Unfortunately someone tips the police and after a hectic car chase he winds up in the slam only to escape and take revenge on those who betrayed and got him there in the first place. A typical action-fest ensues.  Steven Seagal plays himself (surprise!) wearing a trench-coat and sporting his beloved Colt 1911 along with his usual bone-breaking aikido. The Colt and aikido have always been with him, but the first I recall him with the trench-coat is in 'The Foreigner.' It isn't particularly impressive, but it does add a little notch to Seagal's lethal arsenal of [[blows]]. Or it covers up those extra pounds he is packing. Look at it however way you choose. His main buddy throughout the film is played by Treach (another new thing, a rapper in an action movie) and they both uncover a little conspiracy of bad-guys, on both sides of the law, and give each evil-doer his due.  The film's main problem is that is it painfully, and I truly mean painfully, unoriginal. Seagal just follows a clockwork plot throughout the movie and even that manages to get more and more dull as the film progresses. Then it goes from dull to utterly ridiculous in the final scene as people who seemed to be dead on killing each other suddenly, for no reason, start to talk. Groan inducing in every sense of the word. The only real positive thing here is the decent opening - a car chase in Las Vegas complete with flipping police cars and generally entertaining mayhem, but after that brief highlight you've seen it all before. 3/10  Rated R: constant violence and profanity

I've never been much of a gym rat, so take this review with a dose of salt (which, along with sugar, is the only thing that motivates me to work out in the first place). I love food and drink, so exercising has [[once]] become my golden ticket to my personal Wonka factory, where I can consume as I please but still stay relatively trim.   And when I first started really working out a few years ago, I quickly realized that the only way for me to be successful was to accept one of my other personal flaws (outside of gluttony): impatience. I can barely go a few minutes at a desk without wanting to do something or talk to someone, so expecting myself to diligently pound a treadmill for an hour at a time is a sure guarantee of failure. That's why I started to do kickboxing at Lee's Martial Arts in Laveen (see my review). The diversity of exercises, the pumping music and motivation of an instructor made it easy to stay engaged for the full hour required to really burn calories and get in shape.   Given that, when we moved to Central Phoenix a few months ago, I wanted to find a new workout home where classes were a priority--and I didn't have to pay a fortune to get that in addition to basic gym privileges. With that as my criteria, the Y has been more than satisfactory. The cost (only $70 per month for two adults) is really reasonable, the instructors are motivating and seem genuinely happy to be teaching, the free weight room has tons of good equipment for any extra toning I want to do, the locker rooms are clean and the staff is all friendly and helpful. Plus, I can continue to do kickboxing with Marco (great instructor) every Monday and Wednesday at 5:30. I also really like that the facility is housed in an old building. In a city of strip malls and new construction, God knows we could use a little character.   Of course, the Y has downsides (bad parking as others have mentioned, awkward layout, less-than-high-end showering facilities and sub-par food choices), but it's well worth the money, and my waistline, wallet and attention span are all the better since joining.

Lana Turner [[worries]] that she could really dance up a storm in this 1940 [[release]] about the ultimate sacrifice that her sister (Joan Blondell) makes for her.  When both sisters come to New York, they follow Blondell's beau, a wonderful George Murphy, in this film.   As fate would have it, the director of the show is impressed with Turner but sees nothing [[here]] for Blondell except a job as the cigarette-girl. Not only does Blondell miss stardom, boyfriend, Murphy (Eddie) falls for Turner as well. So as not to hurt her sister, Turner is ready to marry the producer of the show, a wealthy womanizer who has wed 4 times.  The story concludes as best as possible with Blondell taking a fast exit back to Nebraska. Look for Paul Ford, as a gossip columnist in the film. He is hard to recognize due to the date of the film and the fact that he is much thinner. The film leaves you with the question of whether Ford and Blondell could ever get together.  Blondell, as the devoted sister, sacrifices both career and love, for her sister. This film is sentimental and might have [[functioned]] better if it had been shot in Technicolor.  Few realize that George Murphy, the future Republican senator from California, was quite a song and dance man in his day.

An apt description by Spock of an all-powerful fop into whose clutches fall the crew of the Enterprise. This was one sector of space our starship should have avoided: first Sulu & Kirk simply disappear off the bridge; a landing party follows them to the surface of an unknown planet and encounter Trelane, a seemingly aristocratic man dressed in attire from an Earth of many centuries past. But he demonstrates abilities of someone or something far beyond human and doesn't register on McCoy's medical tricorder. The officers manage to escape back to the ship but, like some bad cosmic penny, Trelane keeps popping up. He brings them all back, including some female companionship, to continue his games. The dilemma now takes on elements of 'The Most Dangerous Game' out in space and there's an exasperating, even infuriating aspect to the crew's utter helplessness before such unbridled power.  What really makes this a [[sumptuous]] episode is the memorable performance by guest star Campbell as the overpowering but not all-knowing alien. His character is obviously an early version of Q, who was introduced 20 years later in the pilot for the TNG series. Trelane's confrontation scene with Spock stands out among all the strange drama which unfolds. As usual, Kirk quickly begins to look for possible weaknesses in his new nemesis, despite being quite outmatched. The answers to exactly what or who Trelane is are right in front of us the whole time so, when we do learn the truth, it makes complete sense in view of Campbell's pitch-perfect acting. He indulges himself constantly, preening before some unknown audience, remarking on things with a flair which is infectious but not quite right - we can't quite pin it down at first, but there's something missing here. Every few minutes, his tone becomes sinister and the crew now appears to be in serious danger. In a way, you can't take your eyes off him, always waiting to see what he does next. Actor John de Lancie captured that similar tone as Q on the Next Generation series.

i saw this film over 20 years ago and still remember how much i loved it. it really touched me, and i thoroughly enjoyed noel coward's work in it. highly recommended: [[meteorological]] and touching.  i think of this film from time to time, and am disappointed it hasn't enjoyed as much of a revival as [[crowd]] classic films. hadn't realized til i searched for it [[sonntag]] that it won an academy award for best original story for ben [[segal]] and charles macarthur.  [[namely]] it involves a nasty character who destroys another's [[quarry]] and is cursed because of it. he dies, but is allowed redemption if he can convince someone to shed a tear over him. the bulk of the movies shows him in pursuit of this [[intend]]. well written and lovely. i [[gets]] known him for his plays so i was [[dumbfounded]] to see him in this [[rol]] on TV late one night in new york. a must see if you ever have the opportunity.

Let's face it, this is a pretty [[nasty]] film.However if you go in ready to make fun of it you can survive the experience.Okay, you'll scream in agony a lot.African jungle fun in a [[nincompoop]] kind of way.  Tom Conway (who spends most of the film wearing a funky chapeau) is using the local witch doctor and mad science to create a "perfect" being.It looks like a varmint that has been on a six week drunk and is in a sack dress.Ugly is being kind.But it won't kill for him because he's using a good girl as his subject.He needs a bad bad girl.  Marla English and Lance Fuller are two petty crooks in search of African gold.Acting lessons for Ms English should have been at the top of the search list.She's a bad girl and lets everybody know it in a performance worthy of a junior high school play.Mike "Touch" Connors is the white guide English & Fuller con into leading the expedition.  English & Conway finally meet and it is a match made in [[god]].She is the perfect subject to become his voodoo creature because she'll do anything (stress anything) to get what she wants.You will do anything to stop the agony of this movie at this point.  What made this movie interesting for me was Conway wearing that funky tribal hat/headdress/floral piece!Still trying to figure out what kind of dead animal it was.Guess he thought if he pulled it down low enough over his eyes nobody would recognize him.  Truly bad cinema.

The best way to have fun in this [[magic]] is to count how many clichés it is rehashing. Snarling Chinese gangsters. A female vice-president. A ventilator duct that happens to be big enough to fit a big Caucasian male. Shooting through the wall to kill the bad guy. A Situation where you need to snuff out some innocent people to prevent Armageddon. Independence Day scenes where you snuff out some memorable landmarks in a fireball. The vice president in a nice well lighted room surrounded by subordinates, while the Chinese premier virtually alone in a dark room with just bit of dim light shining, snarling as viciously as the slimy gangsters. A lone hero left alone in a ship (building, airplane, whatever) wreaking havoc on clueless bad guys with big automatic weapons. Etc., etc., etc.  The second best way is to count how many zeroes you need to put after the decimal to accurately gauge the probability of the film scenario. I counted up to 45. A president agreeing to a meeting on board a private vessel. The impossibly non-overridable command from the nuke box. The part where the Chinese decided to play shoot 'em up. Etc., etc. Man the earth is more likely fall into the sun than for this film to happen.   I admit the film was interesting until the point the evil Taiwanese gangsters kidnapped the President. Then the boredom kicked in. Suspension of disbelief ceased, and I started thinking the fun I'd have torturing this film...

For our first [[query]] to Golden [[Loong]] we met some friends here for dinner who recommended it.  We [[proceeded]] in and I felt as if I were in a time warp, back to the Brooklyn Chinese restaurants of my youth.  Well, not my youth youth, since a morsel of Chinese cuisine never touched my lips until I was 12.  Every other Brooklyn Jewish family in the golden days of Brooklyn (oh, I forgot that now Brooklyn is trendy, so it's someone else's golden days),  "went Chinese" on Sunday.  It was The Law.  But my family was Kosher, even at home.  No Chinese food on paper plates for us.  But I was a rebel, so the first chance I got, at my friend Regina's sophisticated Birthday Dinner Party, I ate the forbidden fruit.  Regina's mom promised not to tell mine, though she'd promised her that she'd provide Kosher salami for me.  Yeah, right.  Nothing like feeling different from your peers when you're 12.  And it was good.  And I was [[snag]].  But in those days, pre-Hunan, pre-Szechuan, pre-Mongolian, there was only Cantonese.  And that's pretty much what Golden Dragon is all about.  I can't say that my sophisticated palate still loves the blandness of that cuisine, but what we ordered was mostly very good.  Not so much the Hot and Sour Soup because, after all, that's not Cantonese.    Even though our dinner was fairly recent, I can't remember what else we ordered, except for some spare ribs and an excellent Egg Foo Young for appetizers, and we sampled our friends' very tasty walnut shrimp, but everything was pretty yummy and well-prepared.  The service was terrific.  What bumps my rating from three to four stars is the value.  Where else can you get a 40 course dinner - if that's what you want - for $10.50?  Anything or everything on the menu, as long as you finish what you order.  No doggy bags.  None.  But clean your plate!!!  Oh, and they've raised the price a bit, since they now charge $1pp for tea.  But it was very good tea.

I finally saw LAURE and I have to say that I equally [[liked]] it and was dismayed by it. What's great about it is the atmosphere, the music, the location, the cinematography and the [[stunning]] cast. The story is non-existent for sure but with these movies it doesn't really matter. The pace in languid and the settings are exotic. The film has a lot going for it. Unfortunately, it also has a few things going against it. The first thing is that the gorgeous Annie Belle and the handsome Al Cliver have no chemistry whatsoever. Because the two are playing a couple and are on screen for almost the entire length of the film the lack of chemistry between the two is a definite liability. According to IMDb, Al and Annie were a real couple when they filmed this movie. They sure kept their attraction to each other from showing on screen.  The other problem with LAURE is that some sex scenes are just ineffective or even ridiculous. There's one sex scene that stands out as one of the silliest I've ever seen in any soft porn flick: our young blonde couple are picked-up by a helicopter pilot who happens to be a cross-dresser! The pilot flies over the city to pick up his girlfriend (!) and they have an orgy of sorts in the helicopter, in mid-air. And Al Cliver is filming all of this with his 16mm camera! I kid you not. Ridiculous. We later see that 16mm footage being edited on a moviola. While the footage rolls, Al and Annie start making out. This scene is actually good but the footage on the screen behind them was at times too much. Watching the footage of the cross-dresser getting it on with his bimbo while piloting the helicopter almost had me rolling on the floor laughing out loud. Is this supposed to be erotic or believable in any way? The last thing I want to see is a woman pleasuring a man in drag, certainly when the man in drag makes for such an ugly woman, while piloting a helicopter, no less. Al and Annie getting it on was cool as was the music during the entire scene. I just wish the footage on the editing screen wasn't so silly.  Speaking of drag, another dull plot point in LAURE which really drags the movie to a crawl are all those moments with the great Orso Maria Guerrini and his two wives. A married threesome is an interesting idea but it hardly registers here as hot or even interesting. The two women are sorta dull and we rarely see the three having sex. In fact, Orso keeps his clothes on for almost the entire film, even when he's with Annie Belle. This is another minor complaint about LAURE: there's nudity but it's not as much as other films of the same era. It just needed more skin to punch it up.  Except for those minor complaints and the drag queen moments, LAURE is actually very watchable. I love these kind of softcore films from the 1970s when the attention was set on mood and atmosphere, not the crude stuff we see today.  p.s.: make sure to watch Emanuelle in Egypt, which stars Annie & Al but also another famous screen couple, Laura Gemser and Gabriele Tinti. The music in that movie is also great.

[[not]] unimpressed by my first and probably last visit to Chop last Saturday [[nights]].   [[this]] problems started with the hostess, nice [[too]], but [[mildly]] confused. I waited 45 minutes for a table that was [[full]] when we arrived. [[the]] service was piecemeal and I wasn't really sure who our actual server was. The manager took our order and followed up when she could, she was nice enough to offer a larger table than the [[tiny]] [[ones]] that we were initially seated. That effort was the [[pinnacle]] of our night. Others brought our food and the occasional drink refill. But my wife waited 20 minutes for a glass of red wine and was never [[questioned]] if she wanted another.   The menu was [[fantastic]]. We started with a spinach dip and chips and an order of fried calamari. [[but]] very memorable. [[both]] of us had burgers and fries. All the food came out quickly and was fine, but we left [[was]] something better.   The location and atmosphere are great, although from what we sampled of the menu and service, that's what Chop has going for it. All flash and very little substance. At [[most]] that was our experience on a moderately busy Saturday night.

The Hospital is a movie that was made ahead of its time. This [[travesty]], produced by screenwriter Paddy Chayefsky, who gave us the Oscar-Winning film, "Network", deals with overworked staff, gross incompetence, and bureaucratic corruption at a large conglomerate hospital in Manhattan. George C. Scott, in a superb performance as the head physician, is driven to alcoholism and a death-wish, as he tries to recover from a divorce, throwing his son out of the house, and worst of all, a medical facility where corruption and incompetence take precedence over caring and healing of the sick and injured.  Mr. Scott makes the movie his own, and viewers will be shocked at what they observe at this medical establishment. You can feel the "pain" (pun intended) of what this hospital has done to him. The vivid images of this hospital's incompetence are so vivid and dramatically powerful that you may find yourself laughing and being deeply disturbed from scene to scene.  If only the film had stayed with that premise in a documentary style fashion as it starts out, this picture would be brilliant. Unfortunately, there is a sub-plot of Scott falling for the daughter of a senile patient. The patient has been murdering people at the hospital. This is where credibility of the picture becomes strained. The romantic dialog scenes add nothing to the picture, and the mental patient, posing as a doctor, I found to be totally unbelievable. A simple security call and records check should have prevented the senile patient from doing the killings. It takes almost the whole movie, before security people are brought into the film to get the patient out of the hospital. I could not see ONE PERSON doing that much damage, even as corrupt as this hospital is.  Furthermore, George C Scott's character is "overworked" (another pun intended) because the script has too many things happening at once. For example, within a period of 20 minutes, you could have as many as 20 different doctors accused and denying what they should have done or didn't do. With the nurses and aids, it's the same story. Someone's chart was read wrong, someone was given the wrong medication and died, the doctor operated on the wrong patient, than another doctor does the same thing, blaming a third nurse who was not on call because the second nurse who was supposed to be admitting the patient was on her coffee break. There is also a lot of subtle, dark humor with the same messages of incompetence and corruption being fed to the viewer.  This repetition of medical ineptness is unforgettable. However, the murder subplot is a distraction more than a help to this movie. When the focus of this film is on the incompetence of the staff and Scott's reactions to this, you are glued to the screen. But the conversations between Scott and the mad patient's daughter force the film into a mystery type "Who Done it?" scenario that seriously hurts the quality of the movie. When the loony patient is revealing how he did the killings, I wondered the following: Why did the producers need the "find the killer" mad-patient sub-plot? I think the only point of Scott's character having a relationship with the senile patient's daughter, was to give him anybody with whom to communicate. The Hospital should have maintained its scathing indictment of the medical profession by removing the love-interest and mad patient scenes. It should have focused on the incompetent B.S within its walls more frequently. In an era where this movie could have been phenomenal, the sub-plot stories make the film very good instead of the great masterpiece it could have been.

On my list of Dive Bars to visit when in Las Vegas . . . and so we stopped for a quick one before heading back to our hotel.  Best part . . . I drank for free . . . because I was playing video poker.  Not a bad set-up . . . but will all the glass doors . . . you get a feeling that it is kind or small.  Though we did not eat any thing, the food smelled [[outlandish]].  I will most likely be back on another trip to try this place for lunch . . . only because when I am in Las Vegas . . . I like to dinner out at nicer restaurants . . . and this place has more of that homey atmosphere.
I have to make a confession: Usually, when I visit Las Vegas, I never think to leave the Strip.  I know, I know -- Vegas locals despise people like me.  I'm talking about people who routinely fail to acknowledge that, surrounding the much-ballyhooed Strip, there's actually a large, diverse, and happening city  -- a city with countless hidden culinary treasures.  Bachi Burger is one of those treasures.  After Craig R. [[bites]] my interest with his mouthwatering descriptions of Asian-inspired fusion [[whopper]], I had to check it out.  I dropped by here for lunch on a Saturday.  Bachi is located in a random strip mall on Windmill Lane (take the Blue Diamond Rd exit from the 15).  At ~11:30am, parking was a breeze and there were ample tables available.  I guess I should be thankful I missed the massive crowds that are known to congregate here.  The interior isn't much to look at (very minimalist and clean), but Bachi is all about the food.  I enjoyed the [[Samurai]] burger, which was [[boiled]] to a [[irreproachable]] medium.  [[His]] was [[expired]] with a [[ramshackle]] [[burned]] egg, crunchy cole slaw, and tangy BBQ sauce.  However, what really elevated this burger were the caramelized onions, whose depth of flavor was extraordinary.  The burger came with a small ramekin of yuzu aioli, which was also delectable -- I would've licked the damn thing clean if people weren't looking.  On the side, a had a bowl of their chili ginger edamame.  Let me say that this was the finest edamame that I've ever tasted.  Most edamame is overcooked into mush -- but not at Bachi.  Bachi's edamame is crunchy, fresh, and delicious.  The ginger was delightful, and the chili sauce provided a level of spice that was intense but not overpowering.  Service was fantastic.  My server, Kelly, moved quickly and efficiently -- always making sure that I was happily taken care of.  Even the prices are fair, since you're not dealing with the up-charges that are more typical of Strip restaurants.  I can't wait to try Bachi's delicious delights again.  I'm drooling just thinking about it.

I never expected such an old film to be as impressive as this 1930 western turned out to be. The scenes of the pioneers heading west in their covered wagons, encountering storms and mud, river crossings, Indian attacks and every manner of trial and danger, are astonishing in their rugged believability. Much of the film was shot outdoors, and the movie has a [[awfully]] epic [[olfactory]] about it. The actors must have [[skilled]] much the same conditions as the original pioneers did, and the results are astounding. The wagons, the clothing, [[any]] single detail looks and feels [[correctly]]. The characters are simple but believable, with a straightforward story ,that travels like the wagon train to its destination.  John Wayne is slim and youthful in one of his first roles, as the scout leading the wagons, and he does a fine [[manpower]] as the idealistic young frontiersman. He's up against a [[terribly]] scurvy trio of villains, including Ian Keith as a slick gambler, Charles Stevens as a Mexican sidekick and Tyrone Power, Senior, as the growly, bear-like trapper. Power's bearded, snarling, larger than life portrayal is both comic and menacing. I keep picturing him with a bandanna, gold hoop earring and black eye patch, with a parrot on his shoulder, as he grunts and growls various threats and insults. His character could easily be transferred to a pirate ship with no difficulty at all. He nearly steals the whole picture.  Tully Marshall is delightful as a wily old frontiersman who is Wayne's best friend. The lovely Marguerite Churchill makes a spirited heroine, whose initial meeting with Wayne is a hilarious mix-up, resulting in a long running courtship consisting of insults and feigned indifference on her part, to aw shucks persistence on his. The results are quite humorous and one is glad to see them finally get together at the end.  The scenery is amazing, with the wagons crossing real prairies and having to be lowered by ropes down cliffs. Indians who are clearly the genuine article, and not white actors in makeup, appear as both friends and foes, and are treated with dignity. Wayne's character tells an admiring group of young boys that the Indians are his friends, who taught him everything he knows about survival in the wilderness.  The Big Trail is an uncomplicated tale told well by a talented cast and crew. It will probably appear naive to many modern viewers, but there is a quiet dignity about it that never lets it become corny. There is a great deal of intentional humor, including a rowdy rascal of a pioneer, who makes loud animal sounds from hiding , every time the smooth gambler Ian Keith tries to con the beautiful heroine into marrying him. His flowery speeches about the plantation he allegedly owns are interrupted by very realistic imitations of yowling cats and quacking ducks, causing the would be seducer to look around in annoyance for the unseen creatures.  Highly recommended, both for western fans and lovers of old movies in general. This is truly a classic film for the ages.

Victor Sjöström was quite the master in this film, having starred in it, directed it and even wrote the screenplay! That's pretty amazing. While today few have any idea who Sjöström was, he might be familiar to Ingmar Bergman fans as the star one of Bergman's most acclaimed films, WILD STRAWBERRIES.  As far as this [[travesty]] goes, it's a very mixed bag. On one hand, you have to respect it because for 1921, it's a very good film. The idea of the Grim Reaper sitting down with a dead man to discuss his wasted life is pretty imaginative. Plus, the special effect of the Phantom Carriage is pretty convincing and technically speaking this is a well-crafted film. On the other hand, it's an amazingly dated and preachy film--more like something you'd expect to be shown in Sunday School instead of in an honest to goodness theater. Plus, some of the story elements just don't make sense. Instead of coming off as dedicated or good, the dying Salvation Army worker seems like a sap--a very sad and confusing sap. Why is she "in love" with this man? Am I missing something?  So, my recommendation is that if you are insanely in love with silents (like me), then by all means watch it. But, if you aren't a silent fan, this film might do nothing to convince you that this style film is brilliant because the story is so overly melodramatic and dated.

The [[course]] of this story delivers at least one skillfully crafted message to each viewer in the audience. This story is about success, it's about failure. It's about the choices you make in life and the choices others make for you. The story deals with self realization and determination on a scale so large, no camera angle could cover it. Within the grasp of each scene is resides an element marked for depiction within your imagination. Keep this in mind as you watch the movie; it's more than eye candy. The sexually suggestive, rarely explicit scenes serve only to distract and entertain you during the tedious process of character development.
I remember seeing this one in the theatres when it came out, having no idea what it was going to be about and being so pleasantly surprised that I vowed to buy the video when it came out.   While I won't go too far into dissecting this film, I will say that I gave it an 8/10, for all the reasons you can read in the other user's reviews.  What I will say is this:   The first 10 minutes of this film are [[unbelievable]]. It's as close to a textbook audience grabber as I've ever seen. I once put this movie on at a party, where everyone was winding down and getting ready to leave. I just wanted to see what would happen if I showed them the first ten minutes.  Everyone, who watched the opening, stayed to the end.

This was my first look at this short-lived British TV horror series, but I had seen a couple of Hammer horror films (Horror of Dracula, Captain Kronos: Vampire Hunter) and thought highly-enough of them to give this a look.  [[those]] first episode was a shocker - not for the horror but for all the nudity. Was this "regular" TV in England in 1980? If so, it showed a lot more skin than what we see in North America. There were three separate scenes showing naked women and their breasts, one scene where a guy put his hand on one, and another scene with man a top of a woman faking intercourse. Hey, I'm not [[amused]].   The story is a simple one: a witch who had disappeared in the 17th century comes back to her old house and makes life tough for the married man. The latter, Jon Finch as "David Winter," wasn't much of an actor, but his wife wasn't bad and was a really beauty. She was be Prunella Gee as "Mary." The husband suspected her, rightly so, of having an affair and that plays a part in this story.  Patricia Quinn was entertaining as the laughing witch "Lucinda Jessup," who comes back with a mean streak in her and has a good time tormenting the couple until things go wrong at the end. As a man, I'd say it was particular fun to see the two women going at it! This starts off slowly but once "Lucinda" starts stirring up things, it gets very entertaining.
I had watched this as a kid but, not being much of a Jerry Lewis fan, I had completely forgotten it (not that it's in any way memorable). The film revolves around impersonation (which seems to be in the curriculum of every comic star!) - in this case a German officer - and, while not as bad as Leonard Maltin claims (awarding it a BOMB rating), it's not exactly classic stuff [[but]] - certainly leagues behind Chaplin's THE GREAT DICTATOR (1940), even if comparably narcissistic! Ironically, the scenes prior to the appearance of the would-be wacky General offer more felicities than the rather forced humor at Nazi expense!   The film was really Lewis' last gasp during his heyday; in fact, this proved to be his last vehicle to be released for 10 years (it's painfully apparent here that his particular brand of foolishness wouldn't pass muster in the age of Mel Brooks and Woody Allen)!

The undoubted highlight of this movie is Peter O'Toole's performance. In turn wildly comical and terribly terribly tragic. Does anybody do it better than O'Toole? I don't think so. What a [[terrible]] face that man has!  The story is an odd one and quite disturbing and emotionally intense in parts (especially toward the end) but it is also oddly touching and does succeed on many levels. However, I felt the film basically revolved around Peter O'Toole's luminous performance and I'm sure I wouldn't have enjoyed it even half as much if he hadn't been in it.
We open in a doctors room of some sort. A girl is escorted to a seat across from the doctor. He asks her questions. Silence follows. [[It]] continues to ask questions, ignoring the girls obvious traumatised atmosphere.  The [[historical]] is about two girls who are taken home, after spending some time in a mental home after an 'incident' that happened before hand. They are greeted on their arrival by their trying-way-too-hard-to-be-nice-but-so-totally-evil Stepmother, who the girls obviously hold resentment for. As time goes on at home, the evil Stepmother finds new ways to torment the girls. And, to top it all off, there is a vengeful ghost that is far from helping the girls' recovery...  This film is amazing. It has twist, turns, and definitely leaves you a lot to think about without not making sense. The relationship between the two girls is [[too]] heartwarming, it almost makes you cry at some points (I know I had a teary moment of two, specifically 'the cupboard scene'). But what I [[cared]] most about this film is the total feeling of dread all the way through to the rolling credits. The soundtrack is faultless, the furnishings in the house, and the use of colour are fantastic. A pure joy for the eyes. This is a definite must-see for all Asian Movie Fanatics. Or ANY sort of movie fan! An easy 10/10.

[[Possibly]]! [[Miscellaneous]] people who have actually seen this show! It is the funniest anime I have ever [[consulted]], but most people have even heard about it. It is just hilarious.

OK. [[Initially]] said, I just wanted to check whether this [[films]] has an [[middle]] rating below or [[sincerely]] -1. But 5,9. This is [[patient]] than any of the killers' proceedings -,- . That made me curious what people wrote here.. which in the end made me set up an account to give my 2cents of truth into this "well of [[illusion]]" i find here.  How dare you guys even MENTION this movie in the same sentences as e.g. Seven? The only thing they got in common is that they show various crime-scenes. That-is-it. And "[[Coolest]] thriller of 1999!" ? have you even watched another movie form that year? Or any other movie in your life at all? 1999 is not a year which people are reminded of by RESURRECTION... what's with actual MOVIES like 8mm, Eyes wide shut, Arlington Road, Double Jeopardy? (Theyre actually more a "thriller" than this one could ever be..). Resurrection does not even [[merited]] to be dedicated to A SECOND of 1999.  Really, you guys can't be serious. I [[vu]] that movie yesterday with my girlfriend, highly recommended by a friend of her. [[para]] "great film with Christopher Lambert"! ...which I had not yet seen? Hmm..   Well, first look on the Covers: OK, nothing special. At second glimpse you don't need to have supernatural powers to be aware that they simply mirrored Lambert's head, clipped his nose 'n this&that, then made a fancy negative pattern on top of it, to get the killers image on the COVER. You could even think they had some apprentice eat a gallon of marshmallows just to caption that creepy (booooh! -.- ) mouth.. whatever. Turned it around and the plot starts with.. "it's raining in Chicago... blabber blabber". Come on, a six year old could have made that snippet sound more exciting. Now, with this enormous excitement coming from the movies terrific presentation -.- , you absolutely wanna start watching it. Because it can't be that bad, it still is Christopher Lambert. That assumption of mine was proved wrong. WIth "proven wrong" i mean it was brutally executed by a deadly mix of the worst imaginable acting ever known to mankind (every actor, but the tops are the "i can do 1-Liners!" police chief, Prudhommes Wife __ actually a better detective than Prudhomme when she recombines several incidents to a yet ABSOLUTELY UNKNOWN hint in the case!!!! -.- __ and .. yes.. Prudhomme himself) featuring a squadron of inhuman fake feelings, logic errors in a 1-minute-cycle, light-years far-fetched conclusions which in my point-of-view represent an insult to any thinking human being and last but not least a camera-man who obviously was a hyperventilating kangaroo. Oh well, and if you do not completely shut down your brains (these aren't premises to watch it) then you should know who is who and what is what after max. 30minutes, simply because you know ANY scene after the first. That is thrilling. Thrilling because this movie almost makes you think you can tell the future.   The bottom line: This is BY FAR the worst movie I can remember. Trust me, I've seen many horrible movies which in some way were at least only bad attempts or bad copies of another movie. Resurrection however, is the best example on how to fail in every aspect possible. It was so bad that after being shocked by its unimaginably low quality in e-v-e-r-y-t-h-i-n-g, I laughed more often than in any recent comedy, simply because I was fascinated by the crew's brazenness to publish such an -extraordinary- film strip. Good thing for Lambert he was in Highlander:Endgame a year later, thus he can be pardoned. ;^O  Anyhow, I DO recommend watching this movie to EVERYONE. In the end, we had great fun watching it :^D. I guarantee you, after you completely watched Resurrection (be brave, you can do it!) , you will worship the level of acting in any given daily soap.   Or just go 'n watch highlander one more time... that's what I'm gonna do.
The food here was good, but the prices are [[fair]].  I am by no means stingy, and I was expecting to pay a little more for a gourmet pizza...

It's a [[relief]], because I did like the pizza and it would be nice to have a good Italian-style pizza every once in a while.  The gelato is really good, so I'll just stick to that in the future.

During university, our Philosophy professor, Mr.R, played us "Roger & Me" in its entirety. This was at a time when the obese misfit was still pretty much unknown; a charlatan-in-the-making, a soon-to-be-household-name who was still busy honing his fact-bending skills and still learning how to manipulate the easily impressed, the pathologically paranoid, the mentally ill, the sexually frustrated, the illiterate, the semi-literate, the clueless, and the laughably gullible among ye.  As we finished viewing it, I thought: "Yeah, it was somewhat entertaining - in a totally daft Bugs Bunny kind of way - but what an ultra-biased, anti-Capitalist [[publicize]] [[istanbul]] that [[haya]] no objectivity [[whatever]] this is; its sole purpose being to take cheap shots at people and ideas which the film's creator has pet-peeves for. This isn't a documentary by any stretch of the imagination." However, our beloved Marxist professor was absolutely thrilled with R&M, and we ended up not only NOT criticizing any aspects of it, but Mr.R actually spent the remainder of class praising its "qualities". Just so we understand each other, the words "propaganda", "viewer manipulation", "left-wing Extremist", or "selective fact presentation" never exited his perpetually smiling mouth... And just to remind you: this was supposed to be a philosophy class, not INDOCTRINATE YOUR STUDENTS WITH YOUR OWN POLITICAL B.S. course.  Anyway, now I get to the really interesting aspect: this professor, Mr.R, is now a highly successful screenwriter in Hollywood. He has written several left-wing scripts with A-grade stars in them.  The moral of the story: those are the kind of people for whom all doors are open in Hollywood.  Michael Moore is a talentless filmmaker (which he proved beyond a smidgen of a doubt with "Canadian Bacon"), but being a Marxist liberal opens doors to just about anyone. Tinseltown is teeming with rabid pro-Chavez extremists, hence why political brainwashing through simplistic portrayals of reality has been part-and-parcel of the Hollywood experience for many decades now.  Embrace this demagogue and you've betrayed your own brain forever.

I have to tell you I've been a fan of Star Trek TNG since i was a kid.  Well, sometime ago i gave a friend of mine some DS9 episodes and i asked him  "hey man, what are you watching lately because I'm done watching all TNG episodes" He said. "Well, i got these episodes of Farscape". I said: "Ok, let me try it" I was pretty sure at that time that i wont like it because i was just finised watching TNG and [[find]] it [[awful]]."  I had 3 episodes, viewed those but the show didn't impressed me very much, i found it childish initially and i thought its just another TV show, nice adventures but regular. Music was a little bit different, neat special effects though and i had the vague impression that the actors didn't fully get into the characters skin.  I watched another 3 episodes thinking that 3 eps were not enough to decide i like or not since. Then the [[shows]] [[turned]] to get me, i got a good grasp of the action and wanted to see what happened next to the poor Crichton....the rest is history.   [[you]] think i mostly like the freedom of the [[character]] in the context of the action unlike Star Trek where everybody slept when they were supposed to do and way too much high tech bullshit.   The show got better with each episode, very interesting story line.....what can i say, this movie its like poetry.   I highly recommend it!!!

What has hurt this film is everyone and their [[Poof]] Matilda is [[relation]] it to its [[sumptuous]] predecessor, which is always going to [[injure]] any [[depicts]]. If you take it as a western, it's a darned good [[exposure]]. We discover how our [[ascribe]] in 'Lonesome Dove' wind up in the [[incident]] they start up in (Such as: Why do two Texas Rangers, who live on adventure, wind up in a dead town? And how did Gus manage to lose the love of his life?) The performances are very good, and we see the exact same mannerisms the [[idiosyncratic]] will have down the road. The actors did a very good job. The cinematography was superb, and while the music didn't live up to the legendary score of nearly two decades past, that was an impossible task, and it was still fine.  It also helped that we had three episodes, which you just don't see in a miniseries anymore. Heck, it's downright impossible to see a two part telefilm these days.  Fans of the western, rejoice!

I went to see this film because it was recommended to my wife and she wanted to go.  We were both [[getting]] to look at our watches well before the film ended, in order to see how much more we had to endure. Two hours and six minutes long, it is. It's divided roughly equally between battle scenes (about a dozen of them, all more or less interchangeable), and plot development.  One would have thought that with the subject being the son of a minor tribal chief who conquers half the world, plotting would have been relatively easy. There's a fair bit of raw material there from which to make a pretty good story. [[usually]] the writers fluffed it completely. We get no real history. We get instead a Hollywood version of history.  What sustains young Temudjin through his long -- almost endless, actually, or so they seem to the viewer -- tribulations? Why, the love of a good woman, of course.  How does he get out of prison? Well, an old monk, who recognizes his innate goodness and greatness, sets out across the continent to take to this good woman a talisman that symbolises Temudjin's love for her, dropping dead just close enough to her for her to find him as he lies there, talisman in his hand. And of course she then goes and, having (inexplicably) become rich and powerful, rescues him.  How does he escape from the shackles? Well, he goes off to the shrine of the great wolf-god Tengri (or some such name) and Tengri sets him free by magic. Yeah, right.  Why does he want to become ruler of the Mongols? The wolf-god again, apparently. Off goes Temudjin to ask for guidance, and -- surprise! surprise! -- he gets it. "Laws," he says to himself. "What the Mongols need are laws. Good, simple ones." Golly, it was impressive.  And then finally, how does he win the decisive battle against his rival's more powerful forces? Better tactics, certainly, but also through the aid of the good old wolf-god again, who sends a storm at the height of the battle. All the troops cower as the thunder rolls and the lightning flashes (Mongols are scared of thunder, you see) -- but not our Temudjin. The troops, completely wowed by his bravery, acclaim him king!   I don't know what induces people to keep producing this kind of garbage. The funny thing is it's interspersed with all sorts of gritty realism: lots of slurping of milk, dirt and violence. It's as if the producers of this movie wanted to get the trivial things right so that viewers wouldn't notice how infantile some of the big stuff is.  There's heaps of violence in graphic close-up: slashings, impalings, spouts of blood, sprays of blood, clouds of blood -- the blood guys had a great time, actually. Despite the realism, it's impossible to take seriously.  I must mention the ludicrous CGI final battle scene. How anyone can think these things look realistic is beyond me. They don't. Oh, and it's all shot in the standard Hollywood style -- breathtaking panoramas for the spectacular scenery, and the super-close-up Stedicam stuff for the battle scenes. And the standard Dolby super-sound-effects of whumps and thumps and the constant low-frequency hum to sustain tension.  Tedious.  Avoid.

This film, based on the book by Pascal Laime' -La Dentelliere- is an acclaimed [[photographer]] of [[brilliant]] cinematography and costly Italian language. Set in a "scholastic" 19th Century, Balzac-style set, it portraits the story of a mad love story: a man and a woman. There is an infamous line at this shadowy-Mussolinni strike which reads: "She does not smell like tomatoes." Sage perfumery of this Italian masterpiece, Scola is a director of the stature of Mussolinni: his cake will jump in your strawberries and if you let this director he will cream your olives as a Superman. Remember Nietzsche? This one will scare the HELL out of YOU: don't forget to visit Mussolinni's cake next to the Colisseum in Rome, across the Via Appia. This movie will wipe your Pampers inside-out and outside-in, it will make you cry out of Romantic joy! If you liked Ulysses, you will wipe it good with these strawberries until the end of the roll. Enjoy!

Pilot Mitch MacAfee (Jeff Morrow) sees a UFO while test flying a plane--but nothing shows up on radar. Then planes and ships start disappearing and reports of a UFO increase. It turns out it's a giant monster bird that is attacking and killing. But what is it and why is it here?   This has all the right elements for a classic. It has an actually pretty entertaining script--I was never really bored. The [[behaving]] is good (for a 1950s [[creatures]] [[filmmakers]]). Morrow doesn't overdo the macho hero act and Mara Corday is quite good as the requisite female love interest. She's also strong and takes [[considerate]] of herself--even though she IS off getting food and coffee for everyone all during the movie. The problem here is the monster. Dear God--it's TERRIBLE! It looks like a deranged turkey! It has a long neck, a hilariously stupid BEAK, some teeth, a few strands of hair on its head and claws. And--oh yes--it squawks! Not roaring--squawking! The actors had no idea what it looked like--it was added after production. Actors Morrow and Corday were horrified when they finally saw it in a theatre. Morrow said his audience burst out laughing and he left the theatre quickly before the movie ended! Producer Sam Katzman was responsible for this. He wanted to save money and gave the world the stupidest monster ever. And you can SEE the wires moving it too! This gets 4 stars only because Morrow and Corday are so good and the script is well done. It gets no stars for the pathetic monster--wait till you see it attack what is obviously a toy train! Worth a look if you're a horror fan to see what has to be the stupidest monster ever.
Few movies have dashed expectations and upset me as much as Fire has. The movie is pretentious garbage. It does not achieve anything at an artistic level. The only thing it managed to receive is a ban in India. If only it was because of the poor quality of film making rather than the topical controversy, the ban would have been more justifiable.  Now that I've got my distress out of my system, I am more able to [[explorations]] the movie:   * From the onset the movie feels unreal especially when the protagonists start conversing in English. The director, of course, did not make the movie for an Indian audience; however it underestimated its international audiences by over simplifying it. Watching the character of the domestic help conversing in perfect English is too [[magical]] to be true.  * Next we get regular glimpses into Radha's dreams. These scenes are not very [[efficacious]]. They coming up as jarring and obstruct the flow of the movie. I'm still [[invited]] how that philosophical dialogue connected to the story. I felt that the surrealism was lost.  * The love [[pictured]] felt voyeuristic and are probably meant for audience titillation rather than being a powerful statement. In any case, they do not achieve either of the two.  * The names chosen for the women, Radha and Sita, are names of Hindu deities and hence been selected to shock the audiences. However, since the film wasn't meant for Indian audiences in the first place, the shock-through-name-selection is not meant to achieve its goal, which is absurd.  * The quality of direction is very poor and some key and delicate scenes have been poorly handled. A better director could have made a powerful emotional drama out of the subject.  * The acting felt wooden although Nandita Das brought some life into the role, the others were wasted. I always thought that Shabana Azmi was a good actress but her talent is not evident in this film. The male leads were outright rubbish.  In case you are a fan of Earth and wish to see more of the director, stay away from this one. Please.

Watching this series will probably make you feel like how our parents felt when watching [[Fame]] Trek for the first time.  This series [[ai]] it all. The kind of [[storybooks]] that makes you forget how to blink, the kind of characters that makes you want to jump into the TV to join the action, and the kind of atmosphere that makes your hair curdle in awe and endless admiration.  In short, we start out with John Chrichton, an astronaut, who gets shot into a wormhole and ends up with a gang of prisoners on the run from the badguys in black, ironically known as Peacekeepers.  Other colorful characters consists of D'argo, big dude with a short temper and a sword/laser-rifle. Aerun Sun, former peacekeeper and a Ph.D in buttkicking. Zotoh Zhan, who's a plant. No really, she is. She's also a priest, but with a mean streak. There's also Dominar Rygel XVI, an fat lazy bastard who farts helium and generally does more harm than good.  Later in the series we meet the most [[raunchy]] alien that has ever been on television, namely Chiana. A young and seemingly chronically horny Nebari. She is played by Gigi Edgley, which is a name you should remember.  One of the many things I love about these series is that since John Chrichton ended up in this part of the galaxy by mistake, he keeps giving references to "Real Life". Namely, when John is having a bit of difficulty accepting the fact that he will be frozen as a statue for 80 years, one of his many complaint is that when he returns, Buffy The Vampire Slayer will be dead.  So Frell all the other series, get your Dren together and spend an Ahn on one of these episodes. I can assure you, Sci/Fi as you know it, will change forever.  This series has it all. It's sexy. It's actionpacked. It's hillarious. It's Farscape
I returned to this place on my second visit over a few weeks time. [[today]] Pizza has 7 salad menu, [[27]] sandwiches, and [[other]] pizza choice selections or build it yourself in [[multiple]] sizes. [[but]] you can order  the slice(s) and [[then]] they will have [[2]] flavors available that rotates on a daily basis. When I [[returned]] in with my party, we had the [[cuisine]] of Hawaiian, egg plant, pepperoni and cheese. [[me]] [[concluded]] up [[having]] the chicken curry sandwich by which I ask them to [[adhere]] to a salad.  The chicken curry salad was flavorful, [[healthy]], [[cute]] and one that I enjoy. Superlative ....  The pizza are [[small]] slices. When [[myself]] had it last time and order one, [[it]] [[looked]] addicted and ordered a second one. The pizza by the slice, are near [[dry]] and has a near clean bite to it [[rather]] of the oily and heavy stuffing feel that you get from pizza chains or warehouse places. It made me feel not guilty for my [[negligence]]...The cooks here do a good job in making their pizzas. Pizza slices go for about $3 and most of the menu items are about $7 .  The [[waiting]] to get your ordered items is about 4-5 minutes...  [[any]] inside decor is very artful for a pizza place, you have to check it out yourself if you appreciate art. The art looks like it belongs in a hip coffee shop and that is a plus for a pizza place. The place is clean and seats comfortable. There are regular tables and a comfy sofa. There are seating outside as well. Zpizza also share access to the coffee and ice cream shop next door as it is under the same management. You can choose to sit in either shop..  The near midtown location makes it a ideal spot for business lunch or convenient spot. Parking is sufficient... I highly recommend this place if you need to grab a cheap and simple yet tasteful bite by yourself or plan to eat with friends and lounge afterwards at the next door coffee shop. The folks who work here are also friendly. And you can order take out too...
[[Any]] the food is good. Sushi is [[coste]]. Large variety of food.   Dessert: Chocolate fountain, variety of ice cream (including green tea), green tea cheesecake, crepes (made to order), [[manifold]] fruit, [[rubbish]], and mango cake!

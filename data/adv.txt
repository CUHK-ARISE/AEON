Yes, this bizarre feature was written by John Sayles. Shot in Toronto, it's yet another '80s era feature about the dangers of the urban jungle, where the police fear to go and the homeless and the criminal classes are the only inhabitants. Into this mix comes the myth of Wild Thing, a feral young man raised by a bag lady after his parents were murdered by a dirty cop on the take (Maury Chaykin) and Chopper, the local crime lord (Robert Davi). Stir in the local do-gooders (priest Sean Hewitt and clueless social worker Kathleen Quinlan), and you have a recipe for some rather [[rish]] action sequences. Davi is the standout amongst the cast, and cinematographer Rene Verzier does a pretty good job. [[tya]] this is a rather lumpen action pic that won't satisfy action fans and will leaves Sayles' admirers [[ites]].
Vidor shines as Judith, the only truly strong and [[quitable]] member of a strictly patriarchal family. Her brother, David, is so downtrodden by their father that it's a surprise he's able even to tie his shoes, rather than [[s]] Dad to do it for him.<br /><[[rc]] />[[u]] reviewers have already outlined the plot, so I won't rehash it; I will, [[tively]], point out that Nan, who is pregnant by David, is also married to him. This is not an out-of-wedlock pregnancy, which would have been horrific by 1921 standards. [[a]] two are secretly married, but Nan's father, having been paid by David's father, tears up their marriage [[book]].<br /><br />[[cat]] death scene, with Judith in attendance, is a truly [[sque]] [[aring]], and highly charged with emotion. This scene alone is [[cer]] watching the movie for, but there's far more to the plot than that; why on earth aren't modern movies made with the same [[s]] to the story?
This was a great [[l]]...[[we]] don't remember much about about it but remember watching it and loving it. I remember the mother and the father. I really like the Grandmother. She was like a grandmother you really couldn't appreciate until you [[x]] an adult. She was very knowledgeable and no [[xious]]. My favorite song on the show was Sardines in the [[ool]]. (that might not be the title) I remember after [[be]] that show and [[iting]] that song that I went to Cleveland Ohio to visit my [[ie]] and me and my sister sang that song so much that by the time we [[cked]] all of my little cousins were singing it too. I too [[had]] [[tched]] to find this on DVD.
The Italian Job is a real blast to watch. It's a genuinely entertaining film, something you watch just for the sheer enjoyment of it. It's not heavy with drama or emotional hand-wringing, it has no cosmic statements about life, and it's not violent or profane. It's just a [[oof]] movie. Between watching the little Mini Coopers fly around the [[nian]] streets of [[l]].A. and the great [[s]] by stereotypical computer geek-turned-crook (played gleefully by Seth Greene), I had a [[ve]] of fun watching this film.<br /><br />[[o]] kudos to the background music. They [[ately]] set a masterful tone for such a movie, so subtle [[tly]] keeps you on the edge when needed. Apparently a lot of artists contributed to the music, I found it to be the classiest [[ment]] of the film.<br /><br />8 out of 10. Not awe-inspiring but a [[urable]] film to watch at the end of a lousy day at the office.<br /><br />Barky
[[1]] of those movies where you take bets on who will die [[most]] and who will survive at the end. There was just something about the movie that made me zone out. I think because I keep looking [[away]] and thinking "yep still in that tree...still looking at the water". [[quel]] character development. I felt nothing when they were in danger. I was voting for the croc. I found it hard to [[sat]] a croc would try to tip a boat in the [[waite]] [[rral]] and then when it jumps into the boat I [[sher]] that really unlikely as well. The croc seems too supernatural at times ('all [[es]] all seeing'). [[how]] when the croc attacks it's behavior seems very [[like]]. It's a killing machine and wouldn't be [[set]] victims escape twice to three times in a [[rce]], especially when attacking in the water.
This movie had very few moments of real [[orro]]. After the opening minutes the film descended in a spiral that didn't quite take us to hell and back - [[khov]] was pure purgatory to say the least. The acting was more [[º]] than the subject matter of the film and at times I couldn't stop laughing. The continuity between some of the scenes was [[worth]] - characters disappeared from scenes without explanation only to be replaced by other characters who minutes earlier had been some where else. Surely this was a spoof of The Exorcist. The collection plate at the church must have been full of copper the day [[olo]] Russo signed up for this one. Do I speak Latin? Et tu Brutus.
In reaction to the [[iche]] of the films of actual combat in that [[front]], the wartime public increasingly turned to humor as escape from monotony and [[ss]] <br /><br />Charlie Chaplin feared that his [[ieg]] "Shoulder Arms" [[had]] offend people, but it became his greatest hit [[if]] it, Charlie, by luck, courage, and devilish ingenuity wins the war [[games]] and brings a captive Kaiser in triumph to [[claiming]] <br /><br />The chief difference between this [[actic]] burlesque and some of the serious war dramas was that in Charlie's [[raction]] it all [[d]] out to be a dream
This is a pretty [[tute]], [[omic]] version of the "modern" 30s woman's fairytale romance. In this case, she helps the man she loves become head of the company while serving as his secretary and eventually wins his love from a scheming social butterfly. Interestingly, her business sense is shown as subtly parallel to her homemaking prowess, and the ladies of the office are depicted as the "powers behind the throne." Lifted way above the average by Mrs. [[kova]] intelligent performance.
Eight Legged Freaks is a modern monster movie, like a remake of any of the old 'Attack of the giant [INSERT ANIMAL HERE]'-movies of the 50s, 60s and 70s. Or rather, it should have been more like a remake of the, instead of what is was. So, how is a monster movie [[met]] in the year 2002? Well, from the typical opening with some chemical [[y]] the spiders [[en]] to huge proportions, they mix movies like [[dam]], Jurassic Park, Starship Troopers and flavor it with some parody [[in]] Scary Movie. Gremlins is [[ever]] the best comparison, but Eight [[leg]] Freaks was so full of parodies and [[tious]] jokes that it was sometimes more like Scary Movie. It was way too [[t]], at least if you're looking for a monster movie and not just [[the]] parody movie filled with jokes.<br /><br />For a movie like this you don't expect much of the acting, and that is just the way it was. The story though was [[very]] thin, with just a bunch of [[fully]] connected events to show off some action [[ity]] with all of the jokes, leading up to an easily [[evsky]] and corny ending.<br /><br />I rate Eight Legged Freaks a 4/10, and that includes the fact that the special effects where pretty good and that the noises the spiders made where hilarious.
A SOUND OF THUNDER. One of the greatest short stories ever written. By one of the grandest Grand Masters of Fantasy, Ray Bradbury. What a great story.<br /><br />But what a [[nding]] movie! <br /><br />In Bradbury's science fiction short story, a company called Time Safari offers big game hunters the opportunity to go back in time and kill dinosaurs. Rule Number One is: Stay On The Path, a floating metallic walkway that ensures no interaction with the prehistoric environment. During a hunt, a man steps off the path and inadvertently crushes a butterfly. When the hunting party returns to the present - the world as they know it has drastically changed. Though there are paradoxes in any time travel story, Bradbury's tale was a quick jugular stroke, a parable of the ripple effect.<br /><br />A Sound of Thunder was published in 1952 (according to Wikipedia, the most republished science fiction story of all time), and illustrated Chaos Theory, Darwinism, and The Butterfly Effect (which would only be coined in the 1960s by Edward Lorenz). In Bradbury's story, the wonder of time travel was overshadowed by corporate greed, in turn overshadowed by the mortal danger to humanity's existence itself.<br /><br />While in the movie, A SOUND OF THUNDER (directed by the uneven Peter Hyams, CAPRICORN ONE, 2010: ODYSSEY TWO), a clutch of bad actors goes through the time portal again and again to try to rectify their mistakes, like an excrement version of BACK TO THE FUTURE. The movie has nothing to do with Bradbury's powerful tale, except the initial jolt of the time traveling prehistoric hunting party. Egregious liberties are taken with Bradbury's story - baboon-faced reptiles, plants overrunning Chicago's concrete, time waves rippling through the city, CGI insectoids - for which Bradbury should sue the pants and underpants and ass-hairs off the filmmakers.<br /><br />Novice writers Thomas Dean Donnelly, Joshua Oppenheimer and Gregory Poirier should start a Big Balls Agency, for thinking they could actually add elements to a Ray Bradbury story that would improve it. How do these guys walk in a straight line with balls this big? Ben Kingsley is the corporate owner of Time Safari, with a hairpiece so bad it looks like a hairpiece, Edward Burns is his lead hunter, Travis, and Catherine McCormack (who was Murron MacClannough, in BRAVEHEART) is the scientist with the best breasts.<br /><br />I can't possibly relate the hundreds upon thousands of egregious stupidities and asinine pieces of dialog, but here is just one, spoken by David Oyelowo as some kind of "scientist": he refers to the Pleiades star cluster, "The Seven Sisters, they look like stars, don't they? But each of them is a whole galaxy." Uh, no, idiot scientist, they're actually, uh, stars.<br /><br />Those three morons who rewrote Bradbury's story forgot they didn't know anything about physics or astronomy. Or writing.<br /><br />Best part of the movie is Catherine McCormick's chest straining against her disheveled one-size-too-small blouses.<br /><br />--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).

If there was a 0 that's what it would be. THIS PLACE WILL RIP YOU OFF. Forget the particulars because they don't really matter. Very poor customer service and only there to take as much from you as possible. No refunds, no exchanges, no nothing just bend over and take it. Better throwing your money away at the casino than spending it here.	0
I love this groomer!I took my Chipoo, Dany, into Margo's Pet Spa since she was looking a little scrappy. Upon walking into her shop, immediately I could tell that Margo adored animals. That's a great sign!We decided to get Dany trimmed and "furminated", in order to diminish some of the shedding. It only took her a little over an hour to groom Dany. When I came to pick her up, she looked happy and so cute! Margo was very reasonable price wise, and even gave me an extra discount. I will definitely return for Dany's future grooming!	1
TERRIBLE customer service. As I was in line, other customers and I watched the desk person have a conversation with someone who seemed to be a co worker. The people behind me said they had seen her put her hand up so I went up to the counter. She continued talking so I waited. The coworker directed the counter persons attention to me. She replied to her coworker that she had not called me up. I asked if she wanted me to wait or go back in line. She instructed me to go back in line. As soon as I got back to the waiting point, she yelled, next in line! Absolutely atrocious! I will appeal to my employer to use a different airline from now on since their baggage fees make up for or exceed the other airline's fares. I am done with Spirit. Not the first issue I have had with them, but it WILL be the last!	0
Spicy Seafood Pasta, yummy but spicy for me. Try it, you'll love this place. all fish served fresh than any other place. Manager is friendly and humble.	1
ATTENTION all Brides or anyone else who even considers hiring Adam Brooks from Brooks Photography. HE is an absolute fraud!!!!! Adam will take your money and not deliver what is promised in the contract. He will basically disappear on you and will be impossible to reach. He has been recently pulled from Wedding Wire and and will soon be pulled from other wedding websites. Legal action is taking place from numerous people. Adam Brooks from Brooks photography is also in the process of changing his business name. Maybe things have caught up to him and he needs to start over with a new scam. I will be sure to let EVERYONE know his new name once i get all the details. There is no way we will let him do this to anyone else. Especially brides on a very memorable day for them. Wheres the zero star option?	0
The best!  I haven't been there in years and the last time we went it was a 3.5 hour wait but so worth it!  Great for a date if you want to get to know someone waiting in line so long.  My advice is to arrive at 330pm so that way you can be one of the first in line and eat with the first seating at 5pm.	1
Looks like this place is going down hill since the change in ownership.  The little store was out of stock on a lot of stuff, soda machine was broken and dirty towels on the counter. They rang me up for the wrong service and were just unfriendly, not rude but not nice either. I'll be driving the extra miles to find a true Danny's.	0
Went to Baby Kay's on a Friday evening. There was a 30 minute wait.We ordered some hushpuppies for an appetizer. My wife ordered a 1/2 Oyster po-boy and gumbo and I orders the shrimp basket.The hushpuppies came out with a horseradish sauce and ketchup. The hushpuppies were ok, kind of like Long John Silver's hushpuiies. The horseradish sause was excellent though.The service this night was not very good. We waited almost 1 1/2 hours to get our entrees. The server steered clear of us most of the night, which made us angrier. If she would have communicated and offered a salad or something to tide us over, we would have understood.We finally get our food and it is average at best. My wife's po-boy and gumbo were cold. My shrimp basket had 8 measly shrimp on it. We were really hoping for better, especially after the wait.After our experience, we don't know how this place gets such good reviews.. food and service not good.	0
We are quickly becoming regulars here. The patio is always nice even when it's 100 out due to the great misters and nice seating. Service is always great and they actually have a couple great healthy menu options now, the shrimp and spinach salad is probably one of the best salads I've ever  had! Lots of good beers on tap as well!	1
As I've said before, I typically  don't  bother writing a review when there is already a voluminous set of other reviews stating everything I'd want to, and more concisely than I could... but Sakana is my favorite sushi bar in the valley, so I'm still going to add my two cents.I've never had a bad meal at Sakana. Even when busy, which seems to be more often than not as of late, the service is good, the prices are decent and the portions huge.Recently, they started having a Monday night happy hour-ish menu offering discounted maki rolls that include lettuce in the place of avocado. I've also seen promotions offering appetizers for 0.50 when you buy a Kirin or Kirin Light. Oh yeah, last but not least, you get orange slices with your bill... which is a nice touch.	1
I was referred to Dr. Barget for a surgical procedure of crown lengthening which was completed back in December. Not only did I get an absolutely beautiful result but his expert direction in my overall treatment made a tremendous difference in my case. He has a warm, self-deprecating manner, explains things completely and I was just simply really comfortable in his care. The IV sedation that knocks you out is FANTASTIC. Since then, I've been back to have my teeth cleaned in March and loved the hygienist, whose name currently escapes me. My experience was exceptional. Perio surgery can be scary and expensive, but if you need to have it, there is no one better in the valley!	1
My brunch club was super excited to try this place out and we all loved it!!  The upstairs was tiny and for a group of nine wasn't looking good but they were able to seat us in the downstairs section-much more room to spread out. I wish this place took reservations.  They are BYOB which is awesome. For brunch were we not drinking but they had a variety of teas.  We started with their well known homemade donuts. These were amazing. We tired the chocolate espresso (much more chocolate than coffee flavor which I liked), the salt/pepper for a nice savory treat (not my favorite) and the lavender lemon which was delicious!  I want to go back and try more. For my entr\u00e9e I had the goat cheese omelet (without mushrooms and they happily did this for me) with a small salad and red potatoes. The service was great and there was 9 of us. The food is delicious and I can't wait to go back for dinner.	1
Fantastic concept. You walk in to a spacious space where you receive a warm greeted.  You order your donut(s) ala carte and they are made for you fresh in the spot. You choose your glaze(s) and any toppings and they are a dollar each or 11$ for a dozen.I had the maple topped donut with bacon.. OMG. I can't wait to pick up my son from school and come back in a couple of hours!!	1
Club and French onion soup	1
Flew out from LA to catch Bingo Players here back in April of 2012. Never thought it would be the last time I'd see both of them spin together :/ Environment was great! Drinks weren't overpriced. I love seeing DJs on a personal level and this club/restaurant gave you just that! Surprised to see that it's closed now. Maybe it'll reopen in the summer. Rattle on Paul! We know you're watching down on us all!	1
Ate there for Valentine's dinner.  Too expensive.  Portions very tiny.  No bread.  Salad was tasty enough but consisted of about two tablespoons of mixed Greek salad.---I'm not kidding.  My dish was salmon.  The fish was cold and the sauce was congealing.  Had to send it back for reheat.  My Valentine's was sword fish, which consisted of about 3 one inch square pieces. Also cold. No bread, no Pita bread.  The sword fish was about $24, and the salmon, about that much, too.  The wine list was all Greek wine, and the glasses the wine was served in were like little toy glasses, not real wine glasses.  Our waiter was kind of lackadaisical.  There were food splatters on the white wall next to the table.When a short woman made rounds about the tables to ask how we liked our food, we didn't  trust ourselves to even get started, and mumbled, "thank you."  All the "Best of Phoenix" favorable reviews were at least 10- 20 years old.The bathroom had toilet paper stuck to the wet floor of one stall, and the toilet installed inches from the side wall in the other stall.  Weird.  There was a table with chairs outside the bathroom, like they seated overflow guests there.  Weird.We vowed never to go back, and remembered maybe that's why we hadn't been there for years.  Better to eat at Crazy Jim's or Greek Town. Save your money.	0
Maybe I should have tried the pizza and not a sandwich..I usually don't write reviews after one visit but this was so bad, I can't wait.  I looked at their menu online and did see that they offer a cheese sub - awesome (or so I thought).  I go in and order the veggie and cheese sub and watch the gal behind the counter write "turkey and cheese sub, hold the turkey", I'm thinking ok maybe that's how they do it here.   I unwrap the sandwich when I get home and it looks like it had been run over by a car on the way to my table.  The bread was disgusting - a rubbery and chewy slab of thick white bread that they have the nerve to call a hoagie roll.  The contents were a little lettuce, a little onion, a couple of thin tomato slices and one layer of cheese - processed cheese.  When I think back to how the order was written up I wonder if I did literally get the shell of another sandwich.  I moved the scant one layer of cheese from one side to the other, ate that half and chucked the rest.The fact that this sorry excuse for a sandwich came to just under $8 is really just a footnote in comparison to how lousy it was in each and every way.I probably will go back and try the pizza and will be honest and objective when I do, however, I absolutely would never get a sandwich here ever again.	0
The food is really delicious but the cleanliness is the issue.  The plates are always filthy, the tea pots are always gross, the silverware always have left over food.  I have talked to Brenda (the owner) about this issue and she just states that the dishwasher makes the marks on the plates, I then preceded to ask her when was the last time she purchased them and she rolled her eyes and literally went to go sleep behind the booth next to the glass windows of the party room.    It is unfortunate because of the quality of the food this place only gets two stars.  But if you can ignore the disgust of the restaurant and the dirt literally on the tree as you walk in ASK FOR JOHN AS YOUR SERVER, he is always good at conversation he knows how to hype up a plate.  BUT ALWAYS MAKE SURE YOU ARE EATING OFF OF A CLEAN PLATE AND WATCH HOW THEY HANDLE YOUR FOOD AND UTENSILS!!!!	0
Our last meal in Vegas and we came here. We sat on the patio (in January!) and had the best meal we've had in the 5 days we were here. Perfectly cooked filet mignon with Merlot butter and good little French "frites". Great gluten free menu, a gluten free bread and olive plate, and special allergy tags for food.	1
Food was pretty average.  Waitress was pleasant.  I ordered the mixed grill.  It was all chicken.  Where was the mix that was on the menu?!?  $15.99 for grilled chicken and a few grilled onions is not a bargain.  No rice. Burnt naan.  I will return to Puran in Bloomington:)	0
Hands down the best calzone I've had in the Madison area. It was a nice atmosphere and there vice was great. My wife had the gyro platter which was also delicious.If you're in the mood for some good food from the Mediterranean area, this is a great place.	1
If I could give this less than 1 star I would. Service was terrible. They were out of a bunch of different foods. How do you run out of rice?! The waiter couldn't care less. Dirty silverware. Total lack of caring by any of the employees. Took forever to get bread. Didn't get our drink order right...4 waters. Really? Avoid this place. Worst dining experience I've had in Madison...	0
it's tough to find a quality place in a new casino in vegas and not overpay,,,after a bit of looking I believe this is the place. good happy hour, great food and selection make his place a home run @ the Aria casino	1
I don't believe I've reviewed here yet sadly. I must have forgot! We tried the milkshakes for the first time since we loved the chocolate candies & ice cream (the "piece of cake" ice cream is fabbb!) After carefully looking over the many many options for milkshakes,  I decided on the chocolate banana. I was surprised (& HAPPY) that real bananas were used because I expected a syrup. I was so happy to taste chunks of bananas mixed in delicious chocolate put into a milkshake. my boyfriend ordered the piece of cake milkshake which was delicious (very sweet & filling) we enjoyed sharing our delicious shakes!	1
I went once because I live real close, and wanted mexican food. Unfortunately, I will not be going back because it was not good. I got a burrito and it was doused in oil, it was just terrible. I did not even finish it, because it was causing an upset stomach. Maybe I just chose the wrong dish, but that dish caused me to not wanna go back.	0
This is the absolute best burger joint I've ever been to in my entire life. The burgers aren't big like the burgers at fancy restaurants, but they're better this way. The buns are crispy on the inside. The patties are tender and crunchy on the outside. The ingredients are tasty and fresh. The chencho fries, my god, those chencho fries are immaculate. Just go already, you won't regret it.	1
Smashed glass on the floor, straws littered on tables, sticky seats from spilt drinks, it's all here at 'Vodka Rev'. Sounds terrible doesn't it, but read again and you'll notice such shoddy characteristics are not the fault of Revolution itself, its more the clientele. Catch Revolution on any weekend night and it's just plain rowdy. Its popular with students, locals, even a few meaty bruisers and this forms an unruly lot.Still they don't exactly mitigate the issue either, the liberal amounts of cheap vodka sours and heavily alcoholic cocktails (not particularly nice either) are the catalyst here.Best avoided.	0
I can not imagine this place ever getting lower than 4 stars. Great food, wonderful service, and the manager remembers us even though we only go about every 6 months! The happy hour and drinks are great. We have gone to other sushi places in Arizona (from Tucson to Flagstaff) and none other compare! I definitely recommend it!	1
The service was nice, but the food was not.I ordered the Over Easy, and rather than the advertised brioche I was served a soggy slice of bread.  By soggy, i mean complete mush.  The spinach was ok.  The eggs were under-cooked.My friend got the wolf pack and that was good.  Nothing exciting but edible and filling.So far, I am disappointed.	0
Stayed in the hotel for a conference and did not feel like going out to eat. Ordered the caprese salad. Pretty safe bet, right? 5 tiny cubes of mozzarella with 3 cherry tomatoes.  I also ordered the buffalo wings. It was hard to describe the texture but imagine if the chicken had been soaking in water all day and then put in the fryer for 30 seconds. It was weird and mushy and made me question the safety of eating it. The ranch dressing that came with it was also so watery that it dripped off of the carrot stick so that only a thin whitish film remained.  I ordered a side of arugula because I like to eat it with my caprese salad. This was good thinking because it ended up being the only (sort of) substantial thing I ate that night.Service was great, though. Less than a 10 minute walk away is Switch Restaurant, an IHOP and a bunch of other places. Eat there instead.	0
I get all my prescriptions here,  only because its close to my house and also on my way to work, iIt is pretty nasty and worn down in there!!! It's dirty and old, hinky people walking all over the place.  I always feel I have to watch my back in there.  The customer service is nill.  They dont have any type of selection.  But, the pharmacy is ok, my meds are always done and ready on time.  Other then that this place is just weird.  Needs a major make over.	0
Their food is always excellent, no matter what I've ordered (though I must say I love the Salmon salad with jalapeno dressing and the butternut squash ravioli with truffle oil). The firepit is relaxing. The music is fun. The service is sketchy...touch and go. Don't go if you've got a timeline.	1
Worst customer service ever.  Charged me twice for connecting the Internet.  Charged me for a cable TV self-installation kit I never received.  Customer service is indifferent as to how to resolve issues.  TV reception is terrible.  Internet is passable.  DirecTV is a much better option and cost less.  I will never opt for Cox again.  There is nothing good about Cox anymore.	0
Good massage & nice spa but terrible customer service. I booked my appointment over 6 weeks ago after my husband got me a groupon for a 50 minute Swedish massage for when were came to town.  The groupon said to call & mention the deal so that is what I did.After a great massage I went to check out & reminded them of my groupon as I pulled it up on my phone. i was told they had no record of me wanting to use a groupon so I could not use it. i said I must have mentioned it, & I was told if I had mentioned the groupon they would have sent me a confirmation email. I went through my emails & found it, but when I pointed out the email I was told if it didn't mention the groupon then I must not have said anything about it when booking.I asked if I received the massage the groupon covered & was told yes. I said I didn't understand the issue then. Couldn't they scan my voucher & get their money like every other business that offers groupons? I was told it doesn't work this way. I have used groupon before & that is exactly how it worked.When I still asked why I couldn't use my groupon & the company still get their money, the employee said she wasn't able to reach the manager to ask if she could accept it. The employee did call the lady who took my appointment 6 weeks earlier & she said I never mentioned the groupon. Really? She remembers our conversation from amongst all the other appointments being made in the last 6 weeks? She said since I ran the half marathon I could get a 15% discount runners received & I could get a refund from groupon. She explained I would only be paying $7.50 more. Well since groupon only likes giving credit it is not like I will get a refund. I will have to buy more groupons & risk whether or not the business will accept it. So as of now i am out the cost of the massage plus $90.So despite this being a lovely spa, when i  am back in town I will patronize another location. If they don't like groupons they shouldn't offer them.	0
This spot was suggested by family members: Small corner strip mall diner, Walk in and seat yourself. It was pretty busy but we easily found a table. I ordered the Belgian Waffle w/ fresh Strawberries and coffee. I was unimpressed with the "Belgian" part of the waffle. It wasn't as thick with deep pockets as I was expecting. More importantly it was cold such that the individual butter pats didn't even melt. I should have asked to have the waffle made over or at least reheated or toasted but I didn't. The syrup was a sticky plastic bottle of Log Cabin, needless to say it was unheated. However the best part of the breakfast were the fresh Strawberries (they too were cold but oh yeah they're suppose to be), red and sweet but no whipped cream. The coffee was luke warm and very weak we had to ask for a hot fresh cup hoping it would be stronger. The others in my group had traditional egg breakfasts and omelets, with meat, potatos and toast which were just OK. This place is barely average at best and definitely skip the waffle.I was surprised Nick's was so full of people but then again, I was in Surprise AZ. pun intended.	0
cockroach infested! terrible beyond belief. huge ripoff!	0
It was our first time there, and we will be going back! The portion sizes were good, my jumbo shrimp really were jumbo! The combo meals are perfect! They come with an entree, fried rice, a crab wonton and a spring roll. The price was very reasonable for the amount of food. We left satisfied! Also the server was super friendly and attentive!	1
The rooms are fantastic and very spacious for sure.  But the service for a hotel that is supposed to be amazing is HORRIBLE.  Everything takes WAY too long and the front desk clerks are frighteningly stupid.The concierge was actually quite good - but even her good work cannot make up for the complete lack of ability of every single other staffer at the hotel during my stay.  I was really looking forward to being here because its supposed to be the best.  But from the sub-par bartenders, to the overly incompetent front desk people to the almost laughable restaurant staff, I would say save your money and go anywhere else.  This hotel, despite its outward beauty, is pretty much a complete and total lousy place to stay.	0
Had a great dinner last night here!!Atmosphere was casual and upbeat and very comfortable.The menu selection had a great variety and the portions were just the right size to leave room for a yummy dessert.The food had great flavour,and was servered promptly by a friendly waiter.I would  definitely come back to this resturant again!!	1
This was the second time I've been to Bliss. The first time I ordered the Grilled Cheese with Pears, the second time I just went for dessert.  Both times I was disappointed.  The grilled Cheese with pears was small, and didn't have a side.  For 7 dollars I thought it was overpriced, and nothing I couldn't have made at home-just some cheese, slapped on sourdough bread, with some pears.  This past time I had the Brownie Sundae and  it was not very good at all.  The brownie was extremely dry and severely lacking in that chocolatey taste.  The ice cream was good, but I also suspect it wasn't homemade-so that was probably why it was tasty.  There was some carmel drizzled on top of the ice cream with a sprig of mint. That was it. For $6.50 it was way overpriced and the brownie sundae is definitely something I could have made (better) at home. The ambiance at Bliss is great though, and there isn't much noise.The service was alright, nothing to write home about. I would recommend if you're absolutely starving and there isn't anywhere else to go. (you're in downtown phoenix though, so there's always somewhere else to go)	0
I went here on a Thursday afternoon when it wasn't really busy and the vibe I got from the employees was that they really disliked their job. I have been here numerous times and its the same thing every time. I also got sick from the food this time which prompted me to write about it. I think I will try avoiding this place from now on.	0
We stayed here, five people in one room. We drove in the middle of the night and arrived at 9:30AM in Las Vegas. We decided to try to check in early. They did have a room ready for us, actually upgraded to a higher floor that overlooked the strip AND took $50 off the bill. Not quite sure why, but hey, we're not going to argue.The room was clean, didn't smell like smoke (even though some hotels say the rooms are non-smoking, they still smell). The house keeping cleaned up well everyday. The beds were comfy and the bathroom fit two of us at a time for getting ready. Yes, you could hear groups of people when they walked by...but it didn't wake us up or anything. The room served the purpose -- we slept, we pre-gamed, we got ready to go to the clubs. The parking garage was close...make sure you park on level 2, then you don't have to ride the elevator or climb the stairs to get to the casino entrance. The food court is really what sold our group. Starbucks, Subway, Rubio's. Sbarro, McDonalds. We ate here at least once per day. Real savings on food, if you're not looking to spend a lot at hotel restaurants. It was too cold to go swimming, so we didn't see the pool. But we are fans of this hotel and will probably stay again. You can't beat the price.	1
This is a place for a certain type of person. This type of person must not care about service, blood sugar levels, comfort, or feeling welcome in general. Let me explain.Service - there is no service.Blood sugar levels - I'm sorry, you have diabeetus. They empty one bag of sugar per drink, I'm pretty sure.Comfort - ok, I'm not asking for lavish cushions, but isn't it time to get some better chairs and cushions that aren't worn, and worn, and worn again?Are you welcome? Meh. Maybe. Not if you stay longer than 45 minutes. Especially if you have a bunch of people with you.I will say this to their credit - they have a large menu of drinks, some items you can only get from them. That's cool I guess. Too bad everything else sucks. But you can avoid most of those things by just getting your drink to go. Just maybe tell them easy on the sugar bags.	0
got take out here twice when they first opened.  again, small portions and not at all spicy so i havent been back.  also pricey.  if i ask for thai spicy i at least expect to see some bird chilies in my food.  i have a thai cookbook so i guess i should just start making my own although its never the same.	0
Probably one of the worst Chipotle locations that I have visited.  It's crammed in a small ass hole in the wall beneath a McDonald's on the Vegas strip.  It's combined with a Panda express or some other fast food Chinese food joint.  We stopped in for a lunch on a Thursday afternoon.  We were one of the lucky ones to actually find a table.  The food didn't taste as fresh as it could have been either.  There are a boat load of choices for cheap grub on the strip, I should have followed my gut and skipped out on Chipotle.  You've been warned!	0
This is a great place to go if you want to experience some genuine, Pittsburgh culture. Their merchandise is great quality and is covered in all sorts of Pittsburgh (ese) colloquialisms and artwork.  Steelers fans will feel right at home here!Also, the staff is very friendly and accommodating and the owner is a real people person. Check this place out!	1
I'm starting to really like Kohl's as much as I like J.C. Penney. (I like J.C. Penney)	1
I have been here several times and honestly, I do love the decor.  Unfortunately, there's just something disjointed about the whole experience.The food is hit or miss so order carefully.  The sweet onion flat bread and pork belly appetizer dish were both great and super as a combination but some of the dishes are just bad combination of flavors.  Also, twice I have gone in and the entire place smelled like 5 day old fish they cooked anyway.  No restaurant should smell like that.They have a robust evening crowd especially on Friday and Saturday and the outdoor seating is nice.  Unfortunately, the waiters tend to forget about you.  The last time I visited I asked to be reseated mid-meal because although it was not a busy night, they sat a couple both drenched in very strong fragrance, next to me.  Not only does fragrance interfere with the taste of food, but it give me migraines.I excused myself to go to the ladies room and explained to the hostess I did not wish to cause a scene or to offend the new diners and asked if I could be discretely reseated inside that way the other diners would just think it was too chilly for us. She did so graciously but to my great surprise our waiter had a hissy fit.  We sat and sat and sat and sat.  I had already dropped a few bills on wine and half a meal but couldn't finish it for lack of service.It's sad to say but I handled the situation with tact, Vintner Grill did not.There are way too many good restaurants within a short distance to waste your time on Vintners Grill if you are a "foodie".  Overall, I think if you not experienced with fine dining or just happy with kind of average stuff and want a place that is a pick-up joint for "the beautiful people" you would like the crowd and the food.  For me...  it's a well decorated version of something Dante conjured up.	0
Terrible service. They made me return to my house twice because I was missing documents. I did called prior to ask what I needed and they misguided me. I tried to talk to the manager and he was a complete asshole.  I got a little discourage after going home twice without a car and still getting an attitude from the manager when I returned!The manager was so rude that I ended up going to Savmore instead, got great service there, rented a car for 3 weeks, so I guess it's their lost... They not only lost that rental , they lost a costumer for life with me as I will NEVER deal with Advantage again nor EVER tell anyone to rent from them.	0
Lots of study space and the coffee was great!   Recommend the french press... the carafe is enough to keep you going all night!!	1
We tried it for breakfast since we were staying at the hotel and had a two-for-one coupon. If you're in that same situation, there are worse places you could go, but if you're contemplating paying full price, don't. If you're in Vegas to enjoy gambling and shows, this might be a convenient option to fill up. If delicious food is on your "must" list, keep looking.	0
I have been wanting to try this place for a long time.  I should have waited a bit longer I suppose.  The experience I had was not stellar at all.I opted for the breaded chicken salad after contemplating several other items on the menu.  I should have stuck to a sandwich from here.  When the salad arrived, the dressing was missing.  A very important key ingredient to any salad is the dressing.  With me being at work and on a limited amount of time to consume my salad on my lunch break, I had to rummage through the work fridge for some type of salad dressing to top this off.From the description on the menu you are to receive a handful of fries along with all the other ingredients for this salad.  If they consider this a handful of fries, I consider that they have a two year old working there.  I counted, and there were no more than eight total fries on this salad.  The breaded chicken was actually good.  It appears that they may make it on site (I cannot confirm this), but is was lightly breaded.  Not like the chicken tenders at most other restaurants.  Easily the best part of the salad.One other shining star to this salad was that they give you a pita on the side instead of bread.  Giving you the option of putting the salad in the pocket and eating while doing other tasks.  But it wasn't shining enough to give this place more than two stars in my opinion.	0
The ULTIMATE dining experience. Not sure where to begin...but the service is the most grandeur I have encountered. Felt like royalty from various managers coming to introduce themselves and ensure our dining experience was top notch. The decor takes your breath away and the presentation of all courses is simply A+. The menu was as expected and we ordered the fish specials which pleased our palates.	1
Great anniversary dinner. Justifiably recommended by our friends.  Lovely and decadent. We loved it	1
I was pleasantly surprised by my experience. Small thai place in a dead strip mall. Ive seen it there for a few years just have never gone in. Recently my go-to thai place went down hill so I tried something new. Sadly there are a lot of crappy thai places in Tempe. I am no means a thai food expert but I do eat a lot of it. First off, I hate Thai Basil, whoever think that is good thai food has no taste buds. The smell is still there, it reminded me of vietnamese cooking not a sewer so much. I got a lunch to go order of Yellow Curry / Chicken Hot (my stand bys), I had them add bell peppers and Pad Thai / Chicken Hot. The hot level was perfect, nice and spicy to get your nose running but not too hot where you cant enjoy it. The prices were great, $14 for both meals. The portions were very generous. My only qualm was that there were only two pieces of green onion in my pad thai? WTH?! Thankfully I had some at home so I could doctor it up. Next time I will ask for extra green onion. The flavors and spices were perfect. The lady who took my payment seemed to have troubles with the register, but whatever. The place was empty when I was there, hopefully it stays alive since I will now be a regular there. I will certainly go back there.	1
I ended up in the emergency room within an hour of eating here with a terrible allergic reaction to something.  I'm deathly allergic to shellfish and didn't order anything with shellfish in it which scares me that there is cross contamination with the shrimp in the kitchen. I will more than likely not be back, in fear that could happen again.	0
This Walmart sucks, always filthy and never zoned. Produce has rotten fruits n veggies, grocery had out of date products. Management is full of jerks. How do I know this? Oh because I used to work here. They treat the associates like robots who have no feelings. So glad I went to school and got a real job. And to think I almost became the backstabbing piece of garbage with no life manager. Yes fixing cars is a REAL job compared to this place. Oh and I've been shopping this store since it opened and since I was a child, has been disgusting ever since and always will because the hillbilly white trash neighborhood. Why do I keep shopping here? To remind myself of how better I am, I guess.	0
I came across this website last week just a day before leaving for my first Vegas trip with my husband. I was skeptical at first since it seemed too good to be true. But this website is pure gold! So easy and reliable and they are punctual and prompt with giving all the info. In the three nights we were there, we hit two night clubs ( Hyde at Bellagio and XS at Encore) and a dayclub ( Marquee at Cosmopolitan). Got late at the first club, so had to pay a cover charge for my husband, but made up for that with the 4 free drinks they provided!! The other two places got free entry and free drinks as promised. Partying in Vegas is out of the world and this website makes it easily possible without burning a hole in your pocket. I have been raving about it to all my friends and colleagues!	1
It's a Mall and it's a typical AE shop.  Service was great as I was greeted with a smile and asked by staff if I needed assistance.Always great clothing and they had plenty in my size.	1
Yummy yum yum. Excellent sashimi done right with no frills. Speaks for itself.  Ask for Melissa.	1
Wow, such an awesome place to eat at. The bread is awesome, the subs are amazing and the goo balls (peanut butter rice crispies) are to die for.  There's a reason this is a stoner's paradise.Tip: get the spicy ranch, I don't care what you put it on, get it.	1
This store has the worst wc I have ever bin into in any grocerystore . I spoke to the storemanager about it he said it's ok , I  said let's go in to the wc , he said he doesn't need to . This guy is a fat basterd that doesn't give two shits about it . I can deal with it, but my daughters goes in to the wc some times , and the have to sit down . If the take care of this store like the take care of the restrooms, don't go there!!I have bin going to this store for 10 years I'm done. Go to smiths on rainbow !!!!	0
I would like to know why all the good restaurants are by the baggage claim rather than where you are waiting for your flight? When I land I want to get my luggage and get the hell out of there. On the other hand I always like to get to the airport plenty early and relax and get something to eat. The only restaurants near our gate were not very good and stopped serving breakfast at ten AM. Rules made by some over educated idiot that has never eaten lunch at ten in the morning in his life. Life sucks then you get on your airplane.	0
I tried to love it, had a chocolate chip cookie and milk once, and was satisfied.. took my date here after lunch next door and went all out on a vietnamese iced coffee ice cream and red velvet cookie sandwich.. the cookie was too hard and made it not enjoyable for me =(But the ice cream was delicious !	0
We were really skeptical about going here for breakfast while on vacation.  The reviews on here were horrible and there was a long line.  After looking around for a better choice, we decided that this was the best option available.  I am thrilled that we decided to do so.  The line moved very quickly and we got terrific service!  Our server was very personable and friendly without being annoying.  I ordered a Belgian Waffle, which wasn't very expensive and it was delicious.  The prices were a little high, but considering this is Vegas, not out of line.Don't be scared off by all of the bad reviews on here.  This place is terrific.  I'm thinking the other people on here must be a whole lot pickier or impatient than I am.	1
This place definitely has an awesome ambiance...very trendy chic. In respect to the food, there was definitely something left to be desired there. I love how a place claims to be tapas...but it is just smaller portions of a regular dish. That is not tapas! True tapas is small portions yes but incredibly tasty and delectable...something that packs a punch! The food here was okay...we tried the risotto, fish, pasta, and the cheese platter (pretty awful), just to mention a few. For me personally, not worth the price. I have had better and cheaper tapas in NYC.	0
You will love this place. Great food, great music, great service, great price. Great, great, and great all you can eat sushi this is the place! enjoy!	1
TOP TEN DISAPPOINTING THINGS ABOUT LE REVE10.  The music was le bad.  Half of the music was blaring loud Norse God chanting -- made popular in action movie trailers.  The other half was a collection of the cheesiest first draft on the nose Off Broadway tunes you've ever heard -- music that explained to you what the visuals already have, but as if poorly translated from another language.I cannot stress how bad the music was.  At times, you smirked at it more than the clowns.  This is a DEAL breaker.09.  The show was mostly water acrobatics and wire work.  You know, people going up and down and up and down on wires.  Or people diving or falling into the water.  Cirque's 'O' water is way more diverse.  And poetic somehow.08.  Although every seat was awesome, the show wasn't.  So who cares if you can see everything from any seat when there's precious little too see?  Let me rephrase that -- there's much to see, but half of it either isn't engaging or gets repetitive after a while.07.  Good Cirque shows have an artistic cohesion.  Le Reve didn't.  There were too many things wedged in.  A Devil walking around.  Sexy legs in red high heels kicking from the water.  A dude that looked like he stepped out of LOTRs.   Giant flowers.  A samba number.  Clowns in suits.  A giant hydraulic machine.  I was waiting for the kitchen sink.06.  At the beginning of the show, a young voice insists we remember the show instead of taking pictures and videos.  Okay, very cute.  At the end, the same voice returns and actually gloats at how unforgettable the show was.  RED FLAG.  Let us decide if the proceedings were memorable.   And exploit a giggling child's voice to cover up a sloppy show?  DOUBLE RED FLAG.05.  The show is redundant in the Vegas sense.  O is far superior and only a little more money.04.  You call that a romance story?  I dare you to tell it back to me.  And don't tell me to find out what the story was offline.  If it's not IN the show, it's not IN the show.03.  Americans that are new to Cirque can find Cirque productions a little -- pardon my French Canadian -- fruity.  To be fair, the men of Cirque shows typically run around in flamboyant tights and in anally retentively organized androgynous packs.  So when Steve Wynn commissioned Dragone to create REVE without Cirque, there's this feeling he also asked Dragone to 'man up' Reve.  The evidence is all over this overly macho production, despite one clown that liked to kiss boys.  This theory becomes likely when this massive bald muscled man appears beside our heroine.  He's twice her height and size, a dude who just fell off a tank from Mad Max.  And when he beholds our femme fatale -- with a wrestler's body language -- you have no idea if he's going to pick her up in his arms OR tear her into shreds.  So the feminine side of Cirque was oddly removed from REVE, which makes the entire notion of it being romantic even more absurd.  This was an attempt at macho bad @$$ Cirque, which falls as flat on its face as gourmet Taco Bell.02.  Cirque shows, or in this case, Cirque-ish shows are best when you leave the show wanting to see it again soon.  In the case of Beatles LOVE, you might want to see it tomorrow.  O and Mystere warrant a return in a couple of years.  KA is a pleasant misfire and almost worth seeing once.  LE REVE is a "Could I have my money back please?".  It's that disappointing.01.  You're reading this and wondering why my rating is so low and others are so high.  You want to ignore me.  You fear you could miss something amazing.  I frankly can't tell you why many of the other reviewers are going ga-ga.  They are either plants on Yelp to sell Reve tickets, or they haven't seen 'O'. (UPDATE:  It turns out that Cirque's VIVA ELVIS is such a misfire that they're retooling it with more acrobatics from a recently close Cirque show called ZED.  This tells me that LE REVE could retool as well.  I'd rework the show to Madonna music.  But that's just me.)	0
Super smokey inside. The day bartender has real attitude. Not all good. Friendly crowd.	0
Best Italian food in Tempe.  Love the vibe!  So friendly.  Capellini is great, so is the Tiramisu.  Great wine list & good happy hour (before 6 pm) prices.  Oh yeah - also love the broccoli Stromboli.	1
We waited for about an hour for brunch which is a tad too long. The server seemed very rushed and very short with us when she greeted us. When we asked for water she only brought one glass and I had to wave her down to get a second. The food was not very good. It seemed fake, like it had a bunch of fillers. I would best describe it as the IKEA of breakfast food. It was also very bland. The worst part was that both of plates consisted of about 80% hashbrowns. I'm not sure why people love this place so much. We will not be back.	0
This is my favorite bar to go to!!! Right by Mountains Edge, very easy to get in and out of. We always go during happy hour, which is amazing. During any football game they run the happy hour specials too. I recommend the quesadillas and tacos. Always amazing service from the waitresses and bartenders, love Porter! Go Broncos!	1
By far one of my favourite restaurants in Scottsdale. I come every time I'm in the area for a meal. On a warm evening, it's lovely to sit outside in the garden along the canal. A great place for groups or a romantic meal. I've always enjoyed great service and food at Olive and Ivy. My personal faves are their pesto sauce and truffle fries.	1
Not much to say, not a bargain.  If I were in the HRH and hungry, I'd swing around the corner and hit Pink Taco.  Better meal, same hotel.	0
Food was excellent. Great service. Nice wine Selection.	1
This place is a joke!! ATE there once and got some ribs, i gave them to the dog because they tasted like dog bones!!! Went back several months later with my girlfriend again!! because she wanted to try it out and it was the same, horrible place, bad food!!! don't bother going there!!	0
The room is super nice, spacious, clean, and awesome.  I love the staff that works here.  Everyone is very calm and friendly, where they are gracious and never in a rush.  I love earning the points at the Wynn when playing the slots machine because i will always end up getting free buffets for me and my family. I would recommend any one going here.  The view is beautiful and the decor is to die for.  You really feel like you are in a calm serene biosphere.  Relaxation at its best!	1
Everyone in this salon is the BEST! Always willing to go above and beyond for any client, beautiful salon, and lovely ladies. Candace has been doing my hair for a few years now and I wouldnt go to anyone else! :-)	1
Patient/customer centered office. Staff is efficient, professional and dedicated to catering to the needs of their clients. Very impressed with the results as I have struggled with back issues. AZ Chiropractic has definitely earned a life long client!	1
Favorite sports team of all time! Growing up I liked sports...loved boys playing sports and after trying my hand at cheerleading decided I didn't fit in with the conformation of cheering in a group. I was the bane of the squad because I actually watched the game and jumped up out of turn to go crazy and scream during riveting finals tournaments. Yup I "ruined the cheer!!"  I was too hyper to be a cheerleader and ended up becoming a stats girl instead. A much better role, for when the game was nail bitingly close I could yell and jump to my hearts content. This being said I love watching sports and Hockey was the logical choice, that would make it the ultimate sports viewing experience, in my eyes. I mean hockey guys kick ass, the skills it takes ice skating with that tiny puck, the fighting COME ON! In college and highschool I went to many games and when I moved to Pittsburgh going to the Pens games became one of the best times I would look forward to. When I first moved we weren't doing so hot so the games were affordable, and easily attended. So my love of the Pens did not grow from fair weathered admiration. We have the best team in the league and soon after,  we won the cup!! Love, love, love! It's such a "livable" city that it's possible to run into these athletes all over town! I won't give away where I've seen practically the whole team on many nights surrounded by puck bunnies sooo...get out there!  It's fun to see that SOME of them are respectable young men and behave, unlike many the football player. Sorry Stillers the Pens are number #1!! Lets go Pens!	1
A bit dirty, quite dysfunctional, and disappointing is how I would summarize this hotel. We stayed there nights. The TV would not work at all. We called and they sent up a technician. First they came to look at it and said the remote was broken. They never came back. I called again, but the "engineers are busy tonight, there are lots of maintenance calls."The next day I called again. This time they came with a new remote, but that didn't fix it. They promised to come back and look at it again.  They never returned. The 3rd day, I called again. They never came to fix the tv. They never offered to switch rooms. When I asked, they would say to call back again as they didn't know what rooms they had available. I gave up since this was out last night. The room was also a bit dirty. There was mold and filth on the ceiling of the bathroom. It looks like the changed out a light fixture and never cleaned up.There was also a stain on the carpet. And most obviously there was a giant stain on the bench in to room. So obvious, it's the first thing you see when you walk into the room.  I should have just tried to change to a new room when I first noticed that.	0
We are originally from Chicago and are hot dog people so we were excited to try a hot dog dive.  We had 3 different specialty dogs with locavore's, The Chicago, Mexican, and Italian.  All were great even though I was disappointed that there wasn't an open fire charring the hot dogs.  The Chicago was close and the other two were very good except that they were out of guacamole for the mexican.  I would definitely go back if I can get downtown during mid-day.	1
We have been coming here for years, loved the food and the ambience...until tonight. This was suppose to be a special night out for our daughter before she headed off to college. We decided to sit in the bar area..bad idea if you want to be served food quickly. We ordered our dinner at 6:00.at 6:35 our waitress came by to apologize for how long it was taking...apparently there was a private party with 60 people in the area next to us and the food was taking a while. That was a little hard to believe as there was a family of 5 sitting in the restaurant area who got bread and were served long before us...and we didn't get any bread. Our food finally arrived at 6:45. My daughter and I ordered the salmon, my husband-the steak. The salmon was supposed to have a citrus marinade..no citrus flavor was to be found, and it was very dry. My husband's steak was so over done and dry, he didn't even want to bring the leftover home to our dog. We expressed our disappointment to the waitress-who was very nice and apologized..she mentioned the chef is new and we are not the first people to complain about the food. We did get a small discount for the meal, but unfortunately, will not be back.	0
We came to Vegas for a friend's birthday celebration and chose Morels for her surprise birthday dinner.  All i can say is that I was really disappointed and ended up feeling a little sick for the rest of the night.  We called in advance to see if they could do something special for her birthday (like a dessert, etc. that said Happy Birthday) and they immediately told us that they didn't comp any desserts but that they could do something on a dessert we chose (which we agreed to).  The service was a worse than what I had expected and the food was definitely worse than expected.  3 of us ordered the salmon and my other friend and I ordered the short rib.  I heard the salmon was a little undercooked and underwhelming.  The short rib was a huge disappointment - it was very dry and while it was tender, it didn't really go down very well.  I even had to ask for more sauce in hopes of ameliorating the situation, but the sauce didn't help that much.  The mac and cheese was delicious - maybe the best part of my meal.We ordered two desserts to share all around and we even went to remind our waiter to do write happy birthday on at least one of the desserts and we were assured that they were taking care of it.  The two desserts came and none of them had any writing on it.  Then after we were eating for 5 minutes, a third dessert came out with a candle.  It was a pistachio souffle and we were all surprised at how nice it looked.  Until the bill came and they ended up charging us for it even though we didn't order it.The bill ended up coming out late and after we wrote clear instructions on how to split the bill four ways, there was a lot of confusion and it was clear that they ran our cards a couple of times before figuring out exactly how to charge a specific amount.All in all, I was really disappointed with the service and the quality of food -- definitely wouldn't come back here.	0
This place is 10 minutes from my house and very convenient. My family either orders food to go or we go in and eat. The last several times (at least 4) that we've ordered, our meal has been messed up. Either something was left out, or they added something that shouldn't be there.  I've called several times to let them know that the order was incorrect and have been told to "just come back and we'll give you what was left off." Even though it's only 10 minutes, I don't want to interrupt my meal to drive back and pick up the item. This means, they get money for something we didn't get. Well the last straw was this evening when they left off the salad and charged me for it and 2 meatballs, which was really one cut in half. When I called to complain, yet again I was told by the manager and I quote: "do not argue with me, it is what it is. That is the way the meatball comes and if you really want the salad, come in and get it". Are you freaking kidding me... this is the way you treat a loyal customer!!?? I will NEVER again go in that restaurant and I've told all my family and friends. The food is not that great to begin with, and now the service is crap! I suggest you stay away from this place. if you want good pizza, try Casanova Brothers on Val Vista and Guadalupe in Gilbert... that's a 20 minute ride for me, but so worth it.	0
Overall Rice n Noodle has been good until I tried today. I called at 3:45 pm, they told me it was too late for the lunch special that ends at 4pm. I was shocked at the arrogance in how he said it so I questioned him about it & he told me they can't be expected to give away food. WHAT!! I was even more shocked. If there gonna pull things like this, who knows what else they do. Food is ok but not as good as Baidu, or even China a Go Go. Honestly don't trust this place.	0
Over priced & flavorlessMaybe I'm not "hippie dippy" enough. The place is small & was very busy. The wait was insane for a grilled sandwich, soup & a green juice. The cream of leek & potato soup was the only thing that had any flavor. Although $3.95 for a small cup is a little much. The pesto grilled sandwich w/chicken was over priced as well & FLAVORLESS. So disappointing. The "be the change" green juice was disgusting. All the spirulina was stuck to the bottom of the cup, the people didn't even stir it to make sure it blended with juice. $20 bucks and a 15 minute wait for a sandwich, soup that just had to be labeled out of the pot & gross ass juice is NOT something I'll be going back for. Ever.	0
The Polish deli's that have been popping up over the city are each more excellent than the next. Someone has set the standard high, since most are quite upmarket. Bona Deli is no exception - from the minute you step in the door you are faced with delicious bread, pastries, dumplings, Polish confectionery and (powers up) - the meat counter! Polish sausage is an out of this world experience that everyone must try once in their life.They have a great selection of booze that doesn't just consist of vodka - there are some very nice Polish beers that I am eager to try. There are also some polish branded goods in their convenience store section. Lovely, and as appreciated by the Scottish as the Polish quarter of Edinburgh! Friendly service, too. Yum, yum.	1
Gotta love historic theaters playing off beat, artistic, foreign, documentary, etc films. Don't expect Transformers 18 to be on the marquee here. Check Harkins website for shows, show times and upcoming films. Films usually have a short run (1-2 weeks tops) so if you see one you like make sure you jump on it while it's still playing. Parking for theater or anywhere on Mill: the Lot behind the condos off Ash in between 5th and 3rd, near Macayo's, the lot behind Z-Tejas off Maple, pay parking in the garage of Brickyard, east passed Urban Outfitters, more pay parking (not on weekends past a certain time - check City of Tempe for hours - off 5th and Forest Avenue - also close to lightrail station). Street parking with meters in front of House of Tricks and a mega lot that's new off University and College. Overall: Great alternative to your typical dinner and a movie - try a movie here, and dinner at one of the great Mill Ave dining locales (La Bocca, House of Tricks, Cafe Boa, Canteen, Rula Bula, Z-Tejas etc)	1
Friendly, quick and super efficient! Highly recommend!	1
This is the worst company ever. Believe me, you will regret it if you get stuck in a contract with them. They make it impossible to cancel, they demand $$$ from you, and they are rude on top of that. I have never been so irritated about a company. I am taking every possible route to get my word out there. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY ON THIS AWFUL COMPANY.	0
5 stars for the ambiance, 5 stars for the waiter and service.  Zero or minus stars for the vastly overpriced small portions of food that had no proper spicing or taste.  Our table of five agreed that the experience was Not ever going back to Lon's.	0
Definitely different for your average white boy.  Go for number 39	1
I came here with a freebie gyro coupon, and I must say it was way bigger than expected, not dry and the yogurt sauce was tasty, but wish I had a little more, as I ate half and save half for the next day, with no sauce : (   . Yes the average cost for a gyro is $7-8, which is about right... And service was fast and friendly...	1
A buddy and I got talked into this show by the tickets for less guys after the o show wasn't starting again until the following week. This is great for families, stupid for everyone else. Justin did not dance anywhere close to the real mj. At times I felt embarrassed being at this show. Save your money and see the o show. Pay the extra money.	0
Just went for my oil change they had a deal running which was a 6,000 mile oil change for $29 which is very reasonable but they also let me use the check in deal with it so my total was only $20! Lets just say this is the cleanest car shop I have been in. They were all nice and they offer free wifi also they give you complementary water, coffee, tea and even ice cream! I am defiantly return.	1
Love their food! Always fresh and delicious! Not much to look at theme wise, but it's clean and sanitary.	1
My brother took me here the other day for lunch for my first time.  It was great!  Their gyro combo which includes a drink and fries is so reasonably priced at $7.95 +tax.  Free refills on the drink and the fries are seasoned well and extra crunchy.  I love it.  The meat in the gyro is thick and plentiful.  I asked for extra tzatziki sauce - which I don't think they charged extra for.  This is certainly a hole in the wall with excellent food inside.  I'll definitely frequent this place more often for lunch.	1
I f'in love monicals.  Perhaps because I was indoctrinated into loving this pizza as a small child.  However, when I come home to visit I often find myself wanting to come here and stuff my face.  Cheese pizza, topped with their red dressing...so wrong, but oh so right.	1
If I could give this company Zero stars I would. I signed up with them in October of 2011. It took until May of 2012 for my installation to be complete. Building inspectors and APS inspectors showed up randomly to meet with them at my property and they never bothered to show up. This happened about four times. Even the building inspectors were exasperated by the end. A year after installation I noticed I wasn't producing what I should based on the contract and called Sunpower (manufacturer of the system). It took over 6 weeks for Arizona Solar Concepts to send someone out, and that was after I called weekly and finally sent a letter to Sunpower threatening Arbitration. They sent someone out without setting an appointment with me and when they showed up I was on my way to work and couldn't stay. They never called me or notified me of the results of their inspection. Sunpower called me two weeks ago to follow up that everything was complete. I told them I had no idea since no one has contacted me. I still have heard nothing. RUN! Don't walk away from this company. It is run either by the Three Stooges or the Keystone Kops. I haven't figured out which yet.	0
I've never really had a good experience with buffets. Paradise Buffet and Cafe Restaurant reminded me why I avoid them.Yes, it's Vegas. Yes, they are known for world-class food and excellent buffets. Just remember that NONE of them are located in Downtown Las Vegas. The establishment is located in the Fremont casino. It's large and maze-y with roomy booths. The decor isn't vintage; it looks like a 1980s highschool set for Wizard of Oz. There's alot of green.First off, our waitress didn't know what half-and-half was when we requested it with coffee. She kept pointing to the french vanilla creamer already on the table. I already had a feeling I wasn't going to like this place.They had a decent variety of food from American hot-dogs and patties wading in gray, hot water to Italian pasta, dried out from the hot lamps to "Chinese" stir-fry that could rival any MacCormack seasoning packet available at most grocery stores. I opted for jambalaya, fried chicken, mashed potatoes, and beef roast from the carving station. I've never had jambalaya before (at this point) so wasn't sure what to expect; it tasted okay:lots of sausage and my friend told me it tasted like it came from a can. Can you go wrong with mashed potatoes? Yes, even Paradise can! When I attempted to add butter to the flavorless mash, I could only find margarine...Ugh, isn't anything real here? Not too surprising, after all, they didn't have half-and-half... Everything ersatz! Fresh fruit and a piece of apple pie for dessert. Pretty sad when the fruit was the best part of the meal. Lunch buffet cost about $9. A bargain, one might say, for a "Vegas" buffet. All the strip buffets were starting around $30.There's a reason why the restrooms are located at the exit of the restaurant with large, brightly-lit signs. Now, I love food, and if that food disagrees with my digestion but it tastes delicious, I'm willing to give a little leeway. When I eat a less than mediocre meal and additionally have the inconvenience and discomfort of immediately needing a restroom, I am not a happy camper. In toto, six out of our group of eight ended up in the restroom. The women's bathroom was clean, however, the males in our group recounted a disgusting state of the men's restroom.Why 2 stars in stead of 1? Although the entire experience was sub-par, there is a possibility our 6 days of Vegas binging finally caught up to us and contributed to our sickened state. Even without sickness, not worth $9.	0
The service and the food has gone so downhill lately. Used to be so much better. We complained to the guy who said he was the manager and his name was Jerry. He just stood there and laughed at us. I guess when you do so much business you don't need to care about your customers or in this case ex customers. I wish yelp would allow negative stars.	0
I'm a little afraid that by posting this review I'm tempting the indie film Gods to ruin this gem of a bowling alley by making a romantic comedy set here starring Michael Cera as a listless ball cleaner or something, but that's a risk I'm willing to take. The world must know about Arsenal Bowl.Arsenal Bowl single-handedly elevates bowling (a game that's only even remotely cool because of its association with The Big Lebowski) from a dull but convenient excuse to drink beer and make bad puns, to a fun excuse to drink beer and make bad puns. Its vintage d\u00e9cor is awesome--everything inside is oak, the lane numbers are carved in an old tyme style and painted gold, there are deep red curtains draped from the ceiling and the walls are covered in maroon fabric. If it's black lights and murals of bowling pins with human faces you seek, this is not the place to go. There's also a 'secret' set of lanes behind the ones that are visible when you first walk in. The hidden lanes connect to a separate bar, the Upstairs Saloon, so you can kick back a decent cocktail while waiting for your turn (I like to bring huge groups of people because the bigger the group the longer the wait in between my turns). Shoe rentals and games are cheap and every night of the week they have something different going on: karaoke, 80's night, college night, etc. My favorite are the $10 all-you-can-bowl nights.	1
I tried number 9 - grass jelly and pandan jelly with coconut milk. It was good at first but got too sweet after awhile. I'll try something else the next time I'm here. This place is new and clean.	1
Great, clean professional shop. Alex did my tattoo. He is nice, personable and professional. Very happy with my tattoo. Looking at his work his black and gray tattoos are amazing and portrait work is great. Recommended if in Vegas!	1
The low rating for Kobe makes me sad  :(We have stepped away from Kobe for awhile and been going elsewhere, but at no fault of Kobe...we do it with everything.But the call of sushi came tonight and we decided to go back to our old favorite, Kobe!Lately we have been 'failing' at AYCE and not really eating  enough to make the cost of AYCE - but we did work tonight at Kobe.They don't have garlic edamame, which sucks, and I did ask if they could make it for me and the waitress looked like I asked her to make me a Gyro or something. I wasn't expecting it to happen, but I can wish.   Their cucumber salad is always great (a simple thing, but something that I can never seem to get right - I must buy the wrong rice vinegar), the dumplings/potstickers were great!!! (bf thought they were too crispy, but you don't see him Yelping, now do you?) and all the sushi had the right amount of spice we were looking for, was fresh and didn't make me feel sick 20 minutes later.	1
my boyfriend and i went to check out this place.  it was nice and new as what you could expect in a new bar. but the service and the food is not good at all. i tried their sisig it was blunt, on top of that it took forever. the restroom didnt have toilet paper and toilet seat cover.	0
Wow what a great hotel!  Located right in South Park near the mall, this hotel is easy to get to.When you walk in you are instantly greeted by the friendly staff.  The decor is trendy and fun - kind of IKEA-ish.  They have a little shop right off the lobby with lots of items you may have forgotten.  The rooms are very nice - nothing spectacular.  Clean tho and quiet.The ballrooms are huge and typical 'hotel ballroom'.  The patio area outside is nice with a huge tree and seating areas with fire pits - great for those chilly nights.The bar is fun also with an ok selection of wine.  There are high-tops as well as regular tables to grab a meal.Parking was a little tight but other than that it was a great stay!	1
Their Sago with Gulaman is pretty good! Not too sweet, not too bland, just right!	1
So my friends Ivan and Martin kept hyping up this place called rum runner aka badger cafe. It was okay til I receive my burger all soggy with black wet stuff on the side of my buns. I was disturbed... It was by far unappealing. I ate like 1/3 of the burger...never again	0
the service and food is alot better at your local Hometown Buffet then the Sahara buffet.besides the food, the funniest thing about this buffet is the sign at the front of the line limiting your buffet "experience" to only 2 hours.if you can survive 2 hours at this place, you deserve a prize.	0
Love this place. They have a bunch of great little kitchy gifts, sweet-arabilia (candies from "yester years"), some great wines, and a great deli counter.A few of my faves to leave w/, or find a table to enjoy at outside if I can, their hot pressed cubano and a coconut cupcake. De-e-a-licious.Its always crowded here, but if you wait out the line, youll see why.	1
I had never heard of pranic healing before and I'm more than just a little bit skeptical, but I kept an open mind. I went to Ling, originally because I had pain in my shoulders. Immediately , I felt relief, but beyond that, I felt a very rich spiritual connection.  Ling is very sensitive and passionate about helping people. I strongly recommend that every one go to Direct mindpower with a open heart and mind. It will change you!	1
Decor & Presentation: 4 STARSFRIENDLY AND KNOWLEDGEABLE CUSTOMER SERVICE: 3 starsTASTE of cupcakes: 1 STAR(0 stars if I could! why force yourself to eat a cupcake when it taste like it was bought from the GROCERY STORE?)Stay away from this place! Don't let the pretty exterior of this store fool you!Ughh...I AM NOT a big fan of  GROCERY STORE BOUGHT CUPCAKES and that's EXACTLY THE WAY THEY TASTE! If you like DRY cupcakes and HARD, OVERLY SWEET frosting, then you'll like this place. However if you can appreciate QUALITY, texture and taste then STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE! If you're looking for a moist cupcake and soft creamy frosting that will just melt in your mouth, this is definitely NOT a place you want to try out because I've already given you the scoop.I've tried many many cupcake places so I think I know a thing or two about what good qualities go into a kick-ass cupcake and this place was just a huge disappointment. You would think from how wonderful the store is set up that the cupcakes would reflect some goodness...but NO! The cupcakes are just awful :( So awful, I COULDN'T EVEN FINISH ONE CUPCAKE of the box of four my mother had bought me for my birthday. I picked out all the flavors but I didn't like any. I felt so bad I had to throw them in the trash. I took two bites of each cupcake, FORCED myself on the second bite just to see if it would get any better, but it just tasted worse!At first I thought it was just one cupcake that was bad, but then I tried the other 3 and they were ALL just:      Toooo dry,      Possibly too much refined sugar,      Too much artificial ingredients,     Did NOT have that good old HOME BAKED taste,      Tasted like a larger version of cupcakes from the GROCERY store! Stale, hard, OVERLY SWEET frosting and dry cake. All things I definitely don't yearn for when biting into a cupcake. Maybe their cupcakes stay out in that case too long? I don't know but even the formula of the recipe needs to be tweaked or something. Cake is bad, frosting's bad. The nuts and decorations that dressed it up tasted better than the actual cake. Also, what's up with the excessive amount of frosting on top of the cake? Almost piled higher than the cake itself! They seriously put unnecessary large amount of frosting that ended up being tossed in the trash anyway, along with the dry cupcake!Honestly, we could have used the money spent here for gambling money! There's soooo many other decadent places worth visiting than this one, save yourself the trip!	0
Used baby clothes, toys, etc.  I have visited similar stores in the valley and this one seems pricier in comparison-maybe because it's in scottsdale? Also, they buy used clothes but might as well donate it!  They offered me 25 cents for an item that they would probably re sell for $15.00!  Like I said, I'd rather donate it to savers.	0
I stayed here for weekend wedding that was in town. The hotel was much nicer than I expected! Clean rooms, comfortable beds, and one of the best free breakfasts I've ever had (i.e. eggs, sausage, potatoes, bagels, fruit, waffle maker, etc.). We were running late the day of our checkout and the front desk was kind enough to extend out check out time. The only downside was no fridge, which would have been nice to have given the heat.	1
My husband and I decided to spend an overnight in Downtown Pittsburgh last minute. We already had dinner reservations and show tickets, we just had to find a hotel room. The Renaissance Hotel is literally next door to the Byham Theatre where we had show tickets. I walked in and there was a wedding on the iconic stairs in the foyer! It was so beautiful with guests not only seated on the lobby space but also in the balconies on the second floor. I came in just as the ceremony was finishing. and when they were pronounced husband and wife, those in the balcony threw flower petals upon the couple. The hotel handled those like myself who were not part of the wedding very professionally so the ceremony would not be disturbed, but still service incoming guests. Check in was very swift as my husband went to the restaurant to meet our dinner reservation while I checked into the hotel. I was able to take the luggage to the room and return to the restaurant a couple blocks away without even being late. I really liked the makeup mirror since I have to take off my glasses to apply my makeup.We had dinner and enjoyed our show. We got out of the show and went to the bar for a late night bite and a drink. We got there at 10:45pm and waited and waited. At 11:04, a blonde waitress finally came to our table after delivering food to another table. We asked to see a menu, but was informed that the kitchen had closed at 11pm. We finished the drinks we had ordered, but had to pay the bartender because the waitress had left for the night. The bartender was a gentleman as I had two bills stuck together when I paid him and he found us outside to return the other one. We had to go across the street to another establishment to get something to eat.Other than the snafu in the bar, all the staff from check in to check out were very nice and professional. The room was very clean and comfortable. As the need comes up, I will probably choose this hotel when I need to stay Downtown again. It is so close to PNC Park across the Clemente Bridge and it is in the heart of the Cultural District, so all the theaters are very close by. It is also close to public transit so you can get anywhere in Pittsburgh from that spot without having to go too far.	1
I hate this location. Only here does it take more than ten minutes to get the one item I ordered. The staff are friendly, but they move at a glacial pace. If this wasn't right by my house I would never come here. I still avoid is most of the time.	0
Use to live in Phoenix while going there for school and work.  Came back this past week and the food was great as usual.  I also brought a friend who's never tried Hawaiian food and loved the mac/potato salad, katsu bulgogi plate.  Keep up the great work guys and Mahalo.	1
Had a perfect weekend in Sedona and was finishing it up at the talking stick. My overall experience of the resort was great with the exception of the spa. The customer service, attitude and communication of the spa staff was very poor. My main complaint is Terry the spa manager. Her management skills need some work as her communication style was combative and lacked balance. Unfortunaltley the spa staff are a bit snooty and lack good quality customer service skills. Would love to see the resort get some people I'm there who know how to provide good service!	0
Love Ahso!!! Favorite place to go. Happy hour at 9;00 has best prices for fabulous food. I don't eat rice so I had them replace with soy paper and it was delicious... Awesome food and service. Great for little get togetherness with friends or date. They have a DJ on Saturday nights. No dancing but good atmosphere.	1
Very cheap quick lunch.  The sushi is about par with grocery store sushi.  It is mostly surimi salads and surimi sticks, and is a little bit on the dry side. It's nice to have an alternative to the usual food court fare, so it isn't a bad option, just a different option.	0
I love Toby Keith but if he is in anyway associated to this place you better rethink it. I came in just after one today maybe 35-40 people in the bar, but the place is very big after being told we could sit wherever we wanted is server finally came up after five minutes. Said it wasn't even her station but she was going to help us I was the only help we got from her all day. We ordered two beers 1pint 1mason jar and two waters. It took 10 minutes to get our beers and they were served in plastic cups, I know Tobeys into red solo cups but seriously a Sunday afternoon and they don't have any glasses? The waitress apologized and told us she would repour into glass & told us the bartenders had a busy night last night so there weren't many glasses available , what a joke!!! After 20 more minutes we still have not received our waters nor appetizers and we had no idea where our server was so we threw a 20 down &got up and left. I will not go back and would urge you not to go at all	0
I was there one a date and lost the opportunity to bed one of the cutest little French spinners you have ever seen over the service we received.  We waited an hour and a half for our stinky meatloaf.  Followed by our 30 minute wait for cheesecake.  I have to admit the food was actually good.  The problem is the little hot French spinner had a curfew.  She had promised me a great time.  We were late for curfew when we left the Restraunt.  Thanks a lot.  She got back with her boyfriend of 4 years the next week.  I could have been her mistake.	0
This was the 3rd salon I tried out in Vegas after Diva's Studio and Limelight Salon. I came in for a a cut only. The stylist I had was real nice, and at that time had 2 years experience for hair. I asked for a bob cut. I liked she used scissors to cut my thick asian hair. My hair was shorter than I wanted and I wasn't too impressed by how the bob turned out. I wasn't too thrilled I spent $55 for it either. I guess it's worth trying if my friends in the hospitality industry and at my government job were getting nice cuts here...Just not for me.	0
This is a true little gem.  I am perhaps the world's greatest critics of Indian / Nepalese restaurants as I know what I like and they often don't live up to my standards.  I've got my favourite restaurants that I frequent and I do often try others but 99% of the time I leave disappointed.  I'm very happy to say that when I went to The Gurkha Cafe this was the other 1%.  I was anything but disappointed!!!  The interior of this place is really cool, it feels like you're in a little hut as it has open wooden beams all over the ceiling.  I felt as thought I'd taken a plane east by just stepping through the door.  The interior really does set the tone and makes a lovely change from other restaurants in Edinburgh.  I saw someone at the table next to me drinking a Nepalese Gurkha beer so I decided when in Rome...  It was not a bad beer and went well with the food but for \u00a34.95 for 660mls it wasn't so cheap.  Worth it for the label though.  I went for the Mo Mo Cha Nepalese chicken dumplings to start and you could choose this either steamed or fried.  I went for steamed and was SO glad that I did as they were delicious.  I was a bit apprehensive but they were very tasty.  They were crescent moon shaped and there were lots of them - I'm sure I had at least 5 and was full after the starter alone as they certainly didn't scrimp on the portion sizes!  What made this dish though was the sauce that accompanied it.  I couldn't work out what was in it and it didn't say on the menu but this was a tasty little number.  I want to say it was mustard as that's what it looked like but I hate the stuff so know it certainly wasn't that.  No matter what was in it, it was divine and just pushed this dish over the edge and into the exquisite category.  My companion had the chicken satay to start with.  This wasn't the usual Asian chicken satay that you'd normally expect as this was with a Nepalese twist.  The size of this dish could have easily passed for a main course!  There were huge chunks of chicken under a rich, tomato / barbeque style sauce.  As I said, not like the usual peanut style satay but still good.  Not as good as my dumplings though - top tip!!!  :)Another good thing about this place (to add to the huge list) is you can specify how mild or how hot you'd like your meal to be so the dishes really are made to your specific requirements.  For main course I ordered the chicken korma.  When ordering in fact, I asked the waiter what he recommended by telling him what I liked.  I know a lot of people think, 'boring old korma' but this restaurant gave this dish a new lease of life.  The tastes and flavours in this dish were phenomenal.  That's what I love about Nepalese even more than Indian restaurants, they use even more herbs and spices to create the perfect flavours.  Yummy!!!  Again the portion sizes were very generous but it was so tasty that I couldn't stop eating until I'd finished it all.  My fellow diner had the chicken garlic and chilli if I remember correctly.  It came out still cooking on a hot plate and the colours of the dish made for great presentation.  The quantity as well as quality of this dish was unbelievable, we could have easily shared this alone without starters and still left full I'm sure.  She only managed a quarter of it as it was!  As I said above, although this dish is made with chilli she asked for it to be mild and it suited her just perfectly.  We ordered rice and a peshwari nan to go with the main courses.  The nan was lovely, lighter than most nans which was a good thing considering the amount of food and it came in a basket cut into pizza style slices.  This place really does have it all - you can't get a more central location, the highest of quality food with flavours bursting in every mouthful, good friendly service and a different yet cool interior.  It's a winner!!!  As if you can't tell already, I love this place.  Take whatever I've written and imagine I love it 100% more then you'll be getting a bit closer to understanding how much I enjoyed this meal and now love this restaurant.  Honestly, the only thing left to say is try it for yourself.  I'm sure you won't be disappointed and if you are then you can always take the left overs away for me:)	1
Five stars due to this being the best Panda Express I've ever visited. The girl behind the counter was polite to the person in front of me OFFERING samples to them. When I stepped up she was super polite to me and offered me samples as well, and thanks to the sample I ended up getting the honey sesame seed chicken. Absolutely delicious. I asked for both noodles and rice and I expected the usual half-assed scoops of both but this girl hooked it up big time on everything! Despite all these bad reviews I will definitely be a repeat customer!	1
I saw LOVE yesterday, my first Las Vegas show.It was mind-bogglingly fantastic. I was totally swept away and mesmerized for over two hours. The sheer creativity, imagination, music, engineering, intricate choreography left me in a state of deep admiration for the entire effort.It was superb beyond words. See it before you die.	1
Overlook Grill touts itself as a Vegas version of a beachside cafe. Located next to The Cosmopolitan's amazing Boulevard Pool, they managed to do just that, with one key difference: Overlook Grill is less of a beachside cafe in Oxnard, and more like a beachside cafe in Santa Barbara -- trendy and pricey.Showing up in the standard board shorts and tank tops might leave you feeling mildly underdressed in the small cafe area. For sun worshipers, there is outdoor seating available. Service was fast and very friendly, continuing The Cosmopolitan's trend of absolutely exceptional customer service. My server, Leslie, quickly introduced herself and got my drink order, and had it back in mere moments. She checked on me throughout, and even went so far as to offer me a soda refill to go as she presented the check. Now that's a nice extra touch.The food selection is not huge. This is more of a place for simple and fresh than complex and overwhelming. Sandwiches, salads, a few fish items (I don't know why this was listed under "seafood" on Yelp), and a beer & wine list round out the menu. Cocktails can be ordered from the nearby pool bar if you're willing to wait a few moments.I had a tough choice deciding between the Chicken Caesar Salad and the Ground Steak Burger, but went with the burger (there's a shock). The meat was juicy and tender, and the bun nice and soft. Toppings were fresh and crisp, and instead of dropping a bunch of squeeze bottles on the table, they served good portions of mayo, mustard, and ketchup in their own individual ramekins.I LOVE RAMEKINS.I even love saying the word "ramekins." Definitely a classy touch there.I really wanted to try the fried clams, but as I was on a solo culinary adventure, I couldn't justify the piggyness. I would have liked it too if they had a dessert menu. Maybe a nice lemon meringue pie, or lime sherbet. Maybe a strawberry kiwi tart. I do love tarts. (Insert joke here.)The only downfall is the price. After a burger, fries that had a hint of parmesean, and a soda, I was up around $17. Gack. That's not what I would expect to pay at a beachside cafe. That's when I realized, oh yeah, Santa Barbara, not Oxnard. So that is what it is.Overall this place would have received a solid 3 star rating, but the service kicked it up a star. It probably won't fall into the "regular hangout" arena (unless you're part of the Nouveau Douche who parties all night on their parents' credit card, wake up at the crack of noon and roll out for the first meal of the day at 2pm), but for a nice bite for lunch now and then it's a great option.PS: Gotta put out the full disclosure here: I work at the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, where Overlook Grill is located. However, as the hotel encourages honesty from its employees, I have been honest in this review. I am also not affiliated with the F&B department.	1
After the gym, Earl and I decided to pick up a smoothie at Protein House.  It was a very nice, clean.  Upon glancing at the blackboard, I don't see a list of juices so I inquired.  The not so friendly cashier said they only offer one juice, the Green Monster.  I chose Green Monster and Earl chose the Berry Blast Smoothie.  The ingredients used to make green monster includes spinach, coconut water, honey dew, pineapple, lime, ginger, cucumber, and kale.  Tasted like kale and spinach juice though.  There was no hint of sweetness from the fruits.Earl's berry blast smoothie, which we could only taste whey protein.  Overall, glad we tried it, so we know to get something different next time.  I like to try a place thrice before writing it off, therefore, Meh for now.	0
Big sign saying gluten free, but when asked they have no idea what this means. Fryers are shared with flour and corn and so is everything else. They are obviously trying to jump on the GF bandwagon without regard to who gets sick.   Oh well, back to Chipotle!	0
The first time I went I had the short ribs which I will give 2 out of 5. I went back yesterday to celebrate a friends brirthday, and the staff were very friendly and professional but the food was a different story. I figured you can't go wrong with a pizza and ordered the Funghi pizza and oh boy was I wrong. The pizza was extremely salty and had too much oil. They offered to remake it with less salt and when it came out it was the same. Very disappointed by the simple fact they  can't make a simple pizza.	0
I went for dinner with a Client last week while in town for business. We sat at the bar and I immediately noticed the most impressive whiskey wall,(predominantly Bourbon) I have even seen outside of The Library in NYC.  They have it all. THE STAFF: The female bartender Maggie was fantastic.  She was attentive, engaging and knowledgeable.  She spoke to us just enough to make us feel more than welcome without interrupting our business dinner.  The other bartender. Well, all I will say is he was not as interested in being there and seem liked he was having a bad night and wanted out ASAP.  But enough about that. THE FOOD: My Client had the hanger steak and I had the wagu beef steak.  Both we amazing! Also very reasonably priced at $22 and $28.  Cooked to perfection, portion was perfect.  Absolutely spot on! THE BOOZE: They have every whiskey known to mankind, and a very up to date prohibition style cocktail menu.  They have a great signature list as well.  Here is the issue. The pricing was beyond sky high! It was as, if not more expensive than Manhattan.  Actually it was like Dubai not Pittsburgh.  EXAMPLE: The Woodford Reserve Sonoma Cutrer Bourbon which is one of my favorites that Chris Morris of Woodford makes.  It's something I look for and generally,( from low end to high) around $18-$35. This is across the country, from LA to Denver to Houston and Boston.  I travel a lot for business and I can stand firm on this pricing model.  Well, here it was $90 for a two ounce pour. OUCH!! And most of the cool whiskeys like this were outrageous. I won't dwell on the negative pricing anymore.  IN CLOSING: I certainly don't want this to be a negative at all because I loved the place and will definitely visit again when I'm back in PBGH.  However their booze pricing needs to be examined. It was the difference between a 5 star review and 4 starts for me.  If they get the pricing to just industry standard, it will be a grand slam. I also want to try their other restaurant Meat & Potatoes. I heard it was spectacular as well.	1
I love their pork salad. Great healthy food, fresh guacamole. Kinda like the subway of mexican food. Sometimes they forget to give you the vinergerette dressing which really makes the salad so make sure you ask if they don't.	1
My husband and I love their honey hot chicken wings BUT everytime we come here the service is always bad. You have people working at the front with no personality or whatsoever.  Then the girl that takes you to your seat on her butt can hear.  She need to speak up and they need someone at the front who is cheerful and happy to work there.  Then the waitresses are so slow you have to keep looking for them. Ughh so frustrating and it really ruins your night.  I will never go back to this location.	0
Ok i walked in to this place while i was out there for a business trip and was in need of a cut bad i'm usually really picky about who cuts my hair (because its really thick and curly and can look really bad if cut wrong) but i had a big meeting at a casino and needed to look my best. So this women named Kat came up and asked me what i needed and how i liked my hair cut i gave her a general overview of what i liked and asked her to cut it how she would like it, well needless to say when she was done it looked great. There are people who learn to cut hair and then there are people who have natural talent to cut hair and kat was born to style hair thank you, you did an amazing job. I'll be see you for another trim next time im in town.	1
I took my friend there for Sunday brunch today, and it was one of the worst brunches I've ever had in Pittsburgh.  Very limited selection of foods and what was on the buffet was cold and unappetizing.  Very sad excuse for a buffet brunch.  The corn muffins were dry and crunchy.  The fresh fruit on the buffet consisted of sections of red grapefruit and oranges.  There were no fresh veggies, no multigrain anything, no pasta salads, nothing at all interesting or healthy.  And the decaf coffee was horrible -- burnt tasting.  The only redeeming things were the made-to-order omelet station and the alcoholic drink that was included in the $14.99 price.   I felt badly that this is where I celebrated my friend's birthday.	0
Good solid mexican food.  Big portions and small prices.  If you order a burrito or chimi get it wet, I made that mistake only once!	1
I must say... Arby's is one if the only "fast food" joints I go to and my favorite. I live within two blocks. HOWEVER. EVERY time I've been to this location, it's the WORST Arby's experience ever. I get the sand thing every time. Ultimate blt market fresh meal with curly fries and tea. Seems easy, right? Not so easy. Every time I've come here (again it's within one minute) I'm disappointed. Either tiny bacon bits instead of bacon strips, minimal bacon, or tonight !!!!! They had the nerve to serve my market fresh blt sandwich on a regular bun with roast beef. Roast beef!!!! I understand it was probably a new girl, but come on!!!! I didn't even eat it. My boyfriends onion rings were so hard they were worse than a Funyun, but not as tasty. I guess I may have to drive next door to jack in the box instead and risk the gut rot the next day. I believe it will be worth it.	0
It was probably my fault for coming here in the first place given that you guys have not that much selection in food and marked up prices. You would think it would be a given to have exemplary customer service in lieu of your shortcomings, especially given your other competitors, but no it wouldn't, would it? I went here with my $5 gift card that I had won from a box of Keebler Rice Krispy Treats. I purchased a box of popsicles for my son, that totaled $4.63. I wrung up my purchase as credit but your card machine kept ringing the purchase up as debit. The sales girl just kept telling me to hit the green button, so it kept declining since I did not enter the correct PIN numbers, when it was suppose to run as credit. When I tried to explain to her what the problem was, she told me it was declined, and very loudly and rudely if I might add. I kept trying to explain to her why it was being declined, and she had this very flippant, like 'it's not in my job description to care attitude'. And when I asked for the supervisor, apparently her supervisor was the cashier in the opposite register, she proceeded to do nothing. Didn't come over or investigate the problem, she just accused me of not having enough money in the gift card, which wasn't even the problem at all. I obviously have a lot to gripe about, about my transaction with you. First, you should have the cashier helping me blow bubble gums and be on her cell phone the whole day, so as I can be made aware of her total disregard of her job, and will not bother her with trivial questions or assistance. Secondly, I don't think the entire store heard that my card had been declined, maybe you guys should announce that on the intercom since you guys announce everything else on there. Or you guys could totally chip in for a bullhorn. Third, so as not to bother your supervisors from glancing over to see if there workers or customers need help, why don't you use mirrors, or just have them telephone from there very high pedestals. You guys seriously suck the Food out of any City your in, I hope you guys fail every health inspection from here on till your ultimate demise.	0
went for a celebratory dinner- great service, accommodated food allergies, great food.  we hadn't been there in a long time but we will definitely go back soon!love the chocolate souffle, the ahi, the ono, the salads...you name it!	1
Yelp was spot on with this lovely little place.  The food is very authentic and fresh.  The vegetable dishes and noodles were first class.	1
Wait 20 mins to get a parking spot then wait 15 for a machine no thanks. Just cancelled and move to Fitness Connection for $10 bucks a month. For that price I can go to a swanky yoga studio on the weekends and still be cheaper than the Y. This place is seriously over sold. Stop selling more memberships when you don't have enough space or equipment to accommodate current members. Serious over crowding issue.	0
Ok so I've been to a couple locations, and by far, this has the worst wings, I don't think I'll be coming back...I've realized that hooters isn't consistent with their sauces, I guess every location makes their own sauces, I always order hot, sometimes naked, sometimes breaded...regardless i always get hot. This hot sauce had no flavor, it's so bland that I thought they didn't sauce my wings and I ordered extra for dipping...it was just no good. The chicken itself tasted weird...and I'm a wing lover so I know what chicken wing meat taste like when it's old, it tasted old and dirty like it hadn't been rinsed before frying...it was pretty bad. Service is cool though...the best location in the Vegas area is in sunset station in Henderson, it worth the drive...plus they have 20 wings and a pitcher for 20 bucks!!!	0
Occasionally I will come across a hiker or a group of hikers with loud earphones, that cannot hear me coming, so I have put a bell on my mountain bike, and the hikers seem to like the fact that they can now hear me coming.  I would suggest this to other mountain bikers as well to avoid any frustrations.  Hikers have THE RIGHT OF WAY and that is that, so let us be courteous and careful when we are zipping past families with small children and pets.  I hike that area as well with my wife and children and I sometimes get irritated at the mountain bikers that just fly by without even slowing down.  Several trails in the area provide a variety of intensity for the people who want a challenge.  The trails can be a little technical if you are not familiar with "baby head" rocks sticking up, but it also prepares you for some of the other trails Arizona has to offer, like South Mountain, and Trail 100.  All of the trails are "ride able", however, you may encounter some technical areas or long steep climbs that will definitely challenge even advanced riders.  I would recommend this park to anyone with small children who love to get outside and explore.  There is plenty of picnic tables, which I rarely see occupied that are close to restrooms.  There is easy access to the entire park and plenty of parking, for any sized vehicle.  You can reserve different pavilions for parties and they even have a huge fireplace at the top of one of the saddles that you can utilize in the winter.Make sure to bring plenty of water and sunscreen, this is still open desert and there are those hazards even being so close to shopping centers and neighborhoods.  You may encounter a rattlesnake or a coyote as hikers and bikers frequently see them!I hope that you get a chance to come check out this little oasis of trails in Northwest Phoenix when you get a chance, I think you will be quite surprised at the beautiful views and the amount of trails choices that you have.I love this park and will do my best as a frequent user to keep it clean, so others can enjoy it as much as I have!Come check it out!	1
I have been a regular customer here. Every single time I get my car washed, I swear to God it takes this bunch of teen workers forever. The manager had to yell at them to drive the car through the tunnel. They will lose me as a loyal customer because of these lazy kids. Tsk tsk.	0
My dog is 86 pounds of pure chicken. She's a rescue who is still very nervous around strangers (and vacuums, doorbells, and wood flooring), and her size can make her a real monster when she's scared. Yet she still needs annual checkups and booster shots, and Lookout Mountain is the lucky winner. The front desk was very cooperative at shuffling her right into the exam room when we arrived so that she wouldn't have to sit in the waiting room (with all those scary strangers). The vet tech and the vet were both very patient and so very sweet to her throughout the visit. My dog responded very well to their kindness, and actually behaved better for them than she has with any other stranger (even though the mailman has never tried to put a thermometer in her butt!). I'm very happy with how they handled my dog. (Though, from experience, it helps to schedule the first appointment of the morning and call them en route to warn them that a big scared dog is on its way.) They also see my cat, which has also always been a positive experience. (But he's always well behaved at the vet. He's just glad he gets let out of the evil plastic box inside the evil metal box on wheels. He doesn't care what the vet does to him, as long as he's out of the box.)	1
Always a good staple in the community for groceries. If you like fresh and quality, this is your place to shop. Now closer to my side of town, in and out convience for parking, however, (not during the up coming holiday season as I am sure this place will be crowded!) it will be more of a quick trip for me now. I can always find something new to try, today we're trying their mac n cheese, heard it was suppose to be good. Also picked up some can delights for my fur balls, they always enjoy a little pate for dinner. Clean, friendly staff, knows their stuff, very helpful!	1
We went to this place before when it was under different ownership and it wasn't too bad. But this time we were very disappointed. Service was slow. Our hamburgers were tasteless. Very disappointing.  On a more positive note I like how they've added more TVs and I do like the atmosphere, and our server was very friendly. They just need to get a new chef and a new menu.	0
The food itself seems bland and the rice seemed old. Would rather go to the great greek.	0
No one seems to like this place and now I know why. Maybe I'm giving it 2 stars because I'm a fan of their sangria. The chicken tacos are standard. My sis had the chicken skewers appetizer and said they were pretty dry.  I was there for happy hour on a Friday night and it was pretty quiet. Our bartender was nice but not super friendly. Um, I think that was my last visit to Pink Taco.	0
Scale of 1-10 (multiple visits):5 Food4 Service5 Atmosphere4 ValueAn uninspired menu w/ average barfood at best.  This place obviously doesn't serve anything that appears local, organic, original, creative, pretty, tasty, or cheap - and is more obviously just making its money by forcing itself upon a captive airport audience with no other choices.  Come on, you have to offer at least ONE of those things!  Boring boring boring place.But that doesn't mean the service is bad, right?  Well, when I order a bottled beer and the server doesn't tell me that it's a 20 oz bottle, I'm calling bullshit.  So I see this 20 oz bottle come to me and I just sit in confusion for a moment.  I recheck the menu, recheck the label: yup, no way I would have known (not even any prices on the alcohol).  Obviously a scam to try and get people to overbuy.  So i send it back.  "would you like anything else instead?  we have it on draft too."  no thanks; you'll probably give it to me in a two-gallon boot and then charge me $25 for it.  So i got my food and got the hell out of here.	0
One of my favorite places because they host so many events that I enjoy.Barrett Jackson Auto AuctionArabian Horse ShowParada Del Sol RodeoGood Guys Car ShowHowever, it's not an ideal place for large events.  The parking is atrocious.  Anybody who's made the trek to one of these events knows what I'm talking about.  The lots are dusty, dirt lots and oftentimes there's no organization in the lots.you're left to fend for yourself where to park.  Plus the walk to/from the parking lots is far.Also, traffic flow is awful.  You have to dodge cars between ropes with flags that delineate the lanes of traffic and pedestrian walkways.not really safe.The bathroom situation here is really bad too.  There are too few permanent restroom facilities.  Certainly not enough to accommodate the huge events they host here.  The restrooms are like the public park restrooms you see around town.small, concrete structures with a handful of stalls.  Instead, you have to use port-a-potty's.which are nasty.Overall, there are some great events here and in my opinion, the city should put some money into making this a top notch facility for attendees of these events.  However, I just read an article in AZ Central that said Westworld will lose $3 mil in 2014, so I'm not sure any of this is possible.Return Factor - 100% (because I enjoy the events that much)	0
Again ,let me start by saying I am in the restaurant business. Uncle Bears is a cute idea gone wrong. The concept is lost.what is Uncle Bears ? A sports bar, A pet friendly family restaurant?  An offshoot of an often repeated some kind of something with no identity? I am not sure what it is. I am sure that the food is HORRIBLE. Just garbage.The taste reflects the quality.HORRENDOUS. Enough said on the food.Ambience....HUH ? I along with all 4 of my dining companions were totally confused as to what they were trying to do. In addition, we all thought it was a "hollow" feeling in the restaurant. It just doesn't work. It is a cross between several ideas that do not go together at all.Price point is 3 steps above the quality of food being served. Alot of other reviews state precisely this. The price is an insult to those of us that know better. If you don't know better ...enjoy. But enjoy soon the doors will be closing.	0
SOO overrated. These cupcakes just aren't good. I keep trying them with an open mind, thinking they'll get better, bc I love cupcakes. Nope. These things are just tasteless pieces of bleh. The women that work there don't have the best customer service skills either. Smile ladies, your face won't break.	0
Lots of hype... No substance.Hey,  where' the beef...??  No Kidding. Where's the beef..??Had their Pastrami sandwhich.  Extra thick cut of Bread... Ok. Lots of cole slow... Ok... Tons of French fries between buns... Ok...  Pastrami..??... About 2 oz of meat at the best.... No kidding. That's all folks.You get tons of. " FLUFF "  but very little of what the sandwhich is named after...!!!What a disappointment. Folks, you get twice more meat in a Subway sandwhich.  All you are getting is Tons of fluff for $7. Do yourself a favor... Read some reviews about the some better choices in the same vicinity...	0
Five stars for their new happy hour menu, which they call their "economic stimulus package." 4:00-6:00pm and 9:00pm-close: Domestic drafts are 75 cents. Pitchers? $2.99. Small pitchers are somewhere in between. I'm really, really easy to please.	1
I came here for lunch with some coworkers. The place is hip and clean. They seemed understaffed BUT like another Yelper stated, "the food is worth the wait." If you go on Tuesdays, it is dollar-off certain tacos.The tacos I had were delectable - I will be back!A solid 5 stars for food and 3 stars for their lack of servers. (We had to wait a while to get our food).	1
My husband and I really like this tattoo shop. Derek was our tattoo artist. He had me convinced this was where I would want to get a tattoo because he sketches all his work. All my tattoos are unique and have always been sketched from an artist off the top of their head. I prefer to have a tattoo that nobody else will have (it might be similar but never my exact tattoo, unlike people who chooses a tattoo from the wall or the set of pics in other shops). Derek made me feel comfortable. He was friendly, funny and informative. We will definitely go back for another tattoo. This shop does piercing as well and have plenty of body jewelry to choose from. As far as parking, there is parking in the back and the walk to the door isn't far at all.	1
Meh, is right.  I've been wanting to try Vincent's since I moved to the area over a year ago.  I bought a groupon that I've been holding onto for way to long and decided that this was a weekend to go.  Honestly can say that I could have done without. Our first impression upon walking in was old and stuffy.  I get that your a French restaurant, but no need to decorate like we're still in the 80's.  Liquor bottles as a display? Doesn't look good.  It should have felt like an upscale restaurant, but it didn't.I liked that their menu is constantly changing.  Some of their menu options were actually pretty surprising.  My husband and I probably went with the least interesting choices.  I started with the lobster bisque ($8).  For our main courses it was lobster with basil linguine for me and beef tenderloin for him.  The lobster was just ok, the basil pasta was overcooked.  Mike's beef tenderloin was pretty good, but not worth the $34 price tag.  And none of the main entrees were under $32.  I get that you're a "fancy" restaurant, but those prices are way too high.  I have no problem spending $30 on an entree, but it better wow me.  We'll just say Vincent's left something to be desired.	0
My partner and I had our first trip with some friends to the Mellow Mushroom, and I am incredibly sad that we have not stopped in before.  I have been on a quest to find amazing pizza in Charlotte, and I can say that this place has the best pizza I've eaten so far.What makes their pizza so amazing, you might ask?  First off, their crust is scrumptious!  It's part whole wheat, and it has a great, chewy texture.  The wheat gives it such a great flavor.  And secondly, they have such a plethora of toppings you can add.  You can get several different types of cheeses, meats, veggies, and even fruit.  I've got to say, that's pretty wicked awesome.  Finally, at certain times of the day, you can get pizza by the slice.  And I'm not just talking about one tiny slice - the slices are giant!  It's like eating a quarter of a large pizza (well, not quite, but you get my point, I hope).  And it's not just some pre-made slice, you can choose what toppings you add to your pizza.  What a stellar idea!  They have several vegetarian options, and they even have a selection of gluten free pizza offerings too!  Besides pizza, they have appetizers, salads, and even calzones.  They also have a large selection of beers, and apparently you can join their beer club to get rewards.  How awesome is that?And in addition to great food, the decor is all trippin' in there.  They psychedelic theme permeates the tables, walls, and bar area.  They even have an old hippie bus all decorated up, with booths you can sit at in there.  We had great service there, and our server was so enthusiastic.  Their prices are a little higher than other pizza places, but the quality is outstanding.  And if you get pizza by the slice, you can get a large slice with multiple toppings for less than $5.  It's very filling.Oh yes, I will definitely be back here.	1
I just had the worst pizza I've ever tasted from this place.  Many other reviewers seem to concentrate on how good the service is.  The service is good, they delivered my pizza within 25 minutes, but I can't imagine how they could have done a worse job making it.  The chicken tasted like it was irresponsibly old.  I'm glad other people thought it was good but I will not be going back.  Me and a roommate got a pizza planning to split it.  We got about 1/3 of the way through, couldn't finish, and now he is laying on the couch with a sick stomach and I am dissatisfied enough to write my first review of any business.  My other roommate asked me to throw the remaining 2/3 of the pizza in the outside trashcan because it smelled so horrible. I would've given it zero stars if that was possible.	0
I must say I was not happy with my meal service here. Typically , I would never write a less then favorable review . My friend and I arrived @ 11:30 am and ordered our food. Our vegetables came out & the waitress said she would be right out with the meat so we both put our vegetables in the pot. 15 minutes later our vegetables were more than cooked but still no meat. We kept trying to get the waitress attention which should  not have been hard as we were the only table in the entire restaurant . We had to ask 2 tines for the rest of our meal to be provided. Needless to say my vegetables were over cooked and not edible the meat came too late and ruined our meal !	0
UPDATE: after writing this review I did hear from Sarah the business manager at the Downtown Grand as well as from Choice Hotels corporate - well sort of on the latter.  Choice Hotels corporate sent me a joke of an apology letter that did nothing for me nor did it even address my situation - clearly a form letter which is rather insulting.  After playing phone tag with the Downtown Grand for a while, Sarah gave me the option of rescheduling my stay for another time up to July 2015, which is 1-year after I made the reservation.  Unfortunately that also does nothing for me, because I can't get out to Vegas by then.  SO...at the end of the day the Downtown Grand is keeping my $400+ bucks, and I'm getting nothing, which leaves my evaluation at 1-star.  Appreciate the effort from Sarah, but it doesn't go far enough.  Was really hoping for a full refund or at least a partial refund, say all but $100.  FYI - my 4 buddies that I go to Vegas with every year at this time are also incensed about this.  We usually get pizza at the Downtown Grand's pizza restaurant for lunch 1 day during our trip, and they were considering staying at the hotel this time as well.  Well, the restaurant is now off the rotation and they did not reserve their rooms at the Downtown Grand, due entirely to what happened to me.  Hope the Downtown Grand's loss of a couple of thousand dollars of business from us every year was worth the $400+ of mine.	0
I've only gone to the Capital Grille for work-sponsored lunches and dinners so it's easier for me to rank it higher since cost isn't really an issue. If I had to pay for it myself, it would end up as a more special occasion or i-need-a-pick-me-up-lunch type of place. I really like the Capital Grille because even though the focus is on higher end meat and seafood, the vegetarian options are particularly good which is hard to come by at most restaurants in the same category. The Cobb salad (you can get vegetarian) is great because it's big, filling, and fresh. The veggie plate you can special order is a perfect entree, and though it's basically just a combination of all the side veggie dishes I think the sum is definitely greater than the parts. There are buttery roasted mushrooms covered in garlic & rosemary & thyme, grilled asparagus, sauteed spinach, and roasted tomatoes that add a wonderful sweetness and acidity to the dish.	1
The steaks once received were for the most part great if the waitress was listening on the order. In our group of seven she apparently checked out on three of the orders. Outside of that if you have either a flare gun or road side flares then use them as that apparently is the only way to get service from the wait staff. One of our group did snag an employee passing by and asked if we could have our sides served to stave of delirium from hunger due to the pro-longed delay. No dice... Instead we got a kid in a suit advising us to not to "fill up on bread..." As our waitress shouted problems at him that we had brought up earlier.Steaks = greatExperience = badWait staff = terribleManagement = Pretentious... & covering for deficiencies!	0
Been here several times, food & service have been consistently good. They tend to overcook burgers so watch how you order. Family friendly and nice size patio, too.	1
Had to wait a little while, but no big deal. Did not get greeted by anyone in the salon!!! Not even the lady that did my pedicure! The actual service was ok, but the woman that did my pedicure was pretty rough! And she did not shape my toenails very well. Salon also did not have a good selection of nail polishes! Overall, disappointed. : /	0
I have many fond memories at Lulu's. It was my first off campus dining experience while I was at CMU. Food was plenty and affordable. Yesterday, I went back for the first time in more than 5 years. The positives:- things haven't changed- affordable pricing- generous portions- fast service- varietyThe negatives:- things haven't changed- variety (see more explanation below)- overly-Americanized "Asian" food- bubble tea overly sweet and artificialI stick with what I know is decent:- Crab Rangoons- Beef Chow Fun- Pan Fried Noodles- Wonton Noodle SoupThis really isn't a place where you should try something new. If you decide to dine here, check out the reviews and pick which has the most votes.	0
Yeah, these guys know their coffee! Tucked away in this little obscure strip mall about a stone's throw from my house. I had avoided going there because they used to put this mannequin matador out in front of their place. It was sun damaged, kinda creepy and just BAD in so many ways. I know, I shouldn't be such a branding/marketing snob but it was just creepy, I'm serious!That said, they have since removed said matador and we decided to give it a try. Yes, we should have gone way before!! Exceptional coffee and an awesome omelette later, I was completely kicking myself for not trying it sooner.	1
This place is great. Not because I use to work there many years ago, but because this place has great prices and and great service. Matinees are $4.50 and Evening shows are $6.50. People prefer the other newer theaters but your paying a whole lot more. The one thing thats a bummer is that they are finally banning people brining in their own food and snacks. Back when I was working there until a year ago, they finally started cracking down. Thats what was great and seperated this theater from all the others. This place has 12 theaters. Its called Cinedome but only 2 theaters are actually domed lol. They upgraded the seating and painted some vibrant colors inside is about the only difference they have done since it opened during the mid 90's. It is outdated but they run first run movies and actually have a couple 3D screens as well. The snack bar is clean and they actually still have a bulk candy bin. I say if you want to watch first run movies at a great price and not as packed as the big places, this is the place. Until next time!!!	1
The check-in was horrible. We waited 45 min only to see that the room was nothing like we booked. We asked for a non-smoking room with a king size bed, got a smoking room with two queen size beds! They said they will change it at 3 pm today which does not help because we are here for two nights only. So thanks for ruining the first one.	0
Let's be honest: health insurance may be the most morally bankrupt of our major industries.  Even the well-intended Affordable Care Act is the equivalent of putting a mere bandage on a spurting arterial wound.And Physicians Plus will fight to the death to avoid paying for that bandage. You may not have a choice in your health insurance providers, which is fine.  Dealing with Physicians Plus, however, is like pulling teeth.And Physicians Plus will fight to the death to avoid paying for those tooth extractions.We had a baby in September.  It's April now, and I'm still getting bills for standard procedures that have been denied by Physicians Plus (sometimes for the flimsiest of reasons).  I've had to submit several bills multiple times.  They'll cover eventually, but they'll try to wear you down (Physicians Plus will fight to the death to avoid paying for chronic fatigue treatment).  If I were cynical, I'd think they deny claims as a matter of course in hopes that their customers will just give up hope (Physicians Plus will fight to the death to avoid paying for depression treatment).  All in all, you may not be able to avoid them, but they have been incredibly frustrating to deal with.  I'm happy that they are no longer our family's provider, and I hope that I can stop dealing with them before our daughter's first birthday.  I'm tempted to send them a little "sample" in the mail (Physicians Plus will fight to the death to avoid paying for the sample jar).  I may just take that expense out of pocket.	0
PAY ATTENTION TO ALL THE BAD REVIEWS!! They are right. I am currently on hold with COX  - 5 minutes later listening to really bad music on a loop so I decided to share my experience here. I had COX years ago and never had a problem so I decided to go with them when I moved back to the valley. I had several months of "hidden" charges on my bill and was sick of it so I decided to switch. I got a call from Patty in "Outbound Retention" who asked how I would stay. (the fact that that department exists should be a red flag right there) I told her and she got me a lower rate, better service and whole home DVR service...so I stayed. 3 months later. I have had billing problems EVERY month and I am currently on hold trying to keep them from turning my service off because they say I am past due when I am not. Unbelievable. I would switch tomorrow but was told they have to rewire some things in the attic and my walk in closet is the entrance...a lot of hassle. So here I am...on hold. He is getting the job done but I have already spent so much of my own time trying to fix their mistakes. If you are stuck with COX don't hesitate to tell them how unhappy you are, ask for a supervisor, threaten to switch.those things all have seemed to work. (but do it nicely, it seems to have more clout) I am basically going to threaten them if I have ONE more problem with billing I will switch. They really don't want you to go so this seems to be the only way to get your way at this company.	0
Man is a jerk...answers the phone Hello...and like he's drunk! Wow...called to list my Home for sale, but I think NOT! Beyond unprofessional...outright WEIRD!	0
The food is great, and the staff are so nice and friendly. I will definitely be back.	1
So, I decided to try the Flatizza, BIG MISTAKE. Had enough pizza sauce on it to make a large real pizza. The flatbread was so hard I couldn't eat it and the cheese was cheddar not mozzarella.	0
I want to rate 608 higher but I've had so many sub-par experiences here. The wait to get a table is never long (1st star) and the drinks are pretty strong (2nd star). Unfortunately the wait for drinks is always long, even when there isn't many customers. The food takes equally long to get to your table, I've actually gotten a COLD sandwich because the turn around time was so long.The view in the summer is nice, sitting on the roof people watching after being couped up in an office all day is a excellent way to unwind. It's also nice to take your food and drink into the theatre with you if you can't finish in time for your movie.	0
My meal and experience at Blue Ribbon featured the best sushi, sashimi and other Japanese fare that I have had yet! Six of us ventured to the restaurant with our friend and veteran sushi chef and through his connections, dishes were selected and brought to us strategically, rather than ordering off the menu.We began with a couple plates of fresh, delicious, melt-in-your-mouth hamachi (yellowtail) sashimi dosed in a light soy sauce based dressing and topped with thin slices of jalape\u00f1o and perfectly seared ahi (tuna) in its own tantalizing sauce tossed with fresh scallions and mixed greens on the side.Next was the highlight of our night: The Blue Ribbon Special. A two-foot wooden platter decorated with carefully-carved fish skeletons and intricate cucumber designs was filled with an extravagant variety of specialty sashimi and rolls. This included raw uni (sea urchin) on a bed of lemon slices in its own casing, a pile of lightly marinated raw jellyfish, spicy crab rolls, roses made of wild tuna sashimi, madai (Japanese red snapper) sashimi and sake (salmon) sashimi, thin slices of sawara (Spanish mackerel) sashimi lined along its own skeleton, the Blue Ribbon special roll with 1/2 lobster, shiso and black caviar, the Dragon special roll with avocado, eel and radish sprouts, and finally, hirame (fluke) sashimi with its skeleton. Everything was extremely fresh, delicious and simply amazing.To add to an already over-the-top meal, the chef brought us the Karai Ise Ebi roll (spicy lobster in an egg wrapper topped with black caviar) and Unagi (fresh water eel) nigiri. Then, Kobe beef tartare carefully topped with fresh scallions and egg yolk and their version of fried chicken that you dip in a tasty wasabi honey sauce. I finished the meal with a couple of the best spicy tuna, salmon and yellowtail hand rolls I've EVER had.Their fresh and decadent desserts didn't disappoint either. Ginger bread pudding with vanilla ice cream and candied yuzu (amazing!!), green tea, azuki bean and mandarin orange mochi ice cream, and lastly, flourless chocolate cake with green tea ice cream (best tasting GT ice cream, hands down!).When it comes to freshness, creativity and attention to detail, Blue Ribbon is arguably the best sushi restaurant in town. The only "con" is certainly its price tag (our whole meal with a few drinks and a cold bottle of sake, sales tax and very generous gratuity was approximately $1,000 for six). If you're dining as a couple, the Blue Ribbon Special platter will be all you need for a satisfying meal and it could even stretch to comfortably feed four. That being said, it's a toss whether or not the food and dining experience is worth the cost, however, I would definitely love an encore.	1
first time my family and i have eaten at this restaurant and i really did enjoy the atmosphere, food and customer service. The food portions are filling so if you can try to hold back from eating up all of the yummy appetizers, lol. Can't wait to come back in the near future.	1
Beyond being excited about the menu online, walking in I was impressed ; it was huge...loved the environment...the server came right over and after that...down hill it went...calamari was undone and cold, the "all you can eat Catfish +1side" was just unlimited Catfish, i guess the 1 side was supposed to last all night...it was awful...from Catfish lovers..it was a unseasoned guppy of sorts that we had to request seasoning on for the next batch..why in the world did we do that..the last and final batch had seasoning on one side which the server mentioned as she set the plate down like half seasoned guppy was an awesome option. We also ordered the Crescent City Pasta , which had 0-0 seasoning,  presentation was gorgeous but taste fell waaaay short. Next, dessert my Mud Pie good but the Brownie ? was a hard brick of microwaved imperfection, even the server was shocked at how hard it was when we asked him to cut it..shhh my ice cream had ice chips and frost in it but i still finished it, so after the water was over poured and crashed in our laps we finished the evening off with a cocktail and a beer which somehow they managed to get right...we left thinking there couldn't possibly be anyone of Cajun/ Louisiana culture cooking in that kitchen.restaurant has great potential...but i need my potential with some Rhythm(aka: seasoning)	0
I like Chinese food.  Americanized or authentic, from the streets of Wuhan or a plaza in Monroeville, I have enjoyed it.  In light of that, China Palace on Walnut Street is... well... kind of okay.The positives: The vegetarian menu has an especially good selection.  I'm not a vegetarian, but I usually order from that menu just because it's something different.  The food isn't terrible, either, but it's not great.  It's also usually easy to get a table (last time I went there, I tried to go to Pamela's first, but it was a Saturday afternoon, so there was no hope of getting in.)  Oh, and the lunch special pricing is not bad at all.The negatives:Dim lighting that makes me want to sleep.  It's not romantic, just dim.The only waitress I've had there is pretty rude.  She's just not cut out for waiting tables, or interacting with people in general.  My minimum tip is $5, even at the cheapest places.  She got $1.60, because she didn't do the minimum amount of customer service I require to give my minimum tip.The food is only okay.  All in all, if you're on Walnut and you can avoid China Palace, try something else.  You won't HATE your experience here, but it won't be memorable, either.  I will probably return, though, for the cheap lunch specials, but that's because I'm moving out of country soon and I need to save every penny I can, not because I really love the place.	0
Love the atmosphere of this place, but the service SUCKS. Just when we thought it couldn't get any worse. We come here every Monday to listen to our friends play acoustic during happy hour. Up until this past Monday (5/19/14), we could put up with the horrible service, but when there are only four tables seated and you have to wait for over 10 minutes to put in your first drink order, should've been a sign of things to come. We could see the waitress peeking around the pillar at us and then go back to her conversation with her coworkers. The waitress was fairly new because I remember meeting her last week, but they are all the same. Our food order was taken just after our drinks were delivered and still had not arrived after 45 minutes ( it never takes that long). She informed us that it would be right out but still never came. After sitting there with empty glasses for 20 minutes we decided to close our tab. We were there a total of 90 minutes. We will never be coming back to this place again.	0
I really don't have much of a sweet tooth, but when I have a craving for something sweet and delicious, I gladly make the 40+ mile round trip for LuvIt custard. Pay no attention to the flavor list on the big menu board- just use it as the pricing guide. The daily flavors are posted on the left side of the order window. They have vanilla and chocolate every day along with 2, sometimes 3 daily flavors. The flavors of the day are also listed on their website for weeks and weeks in advance, so you can plan in advance for your favorite daily flavors. They also offer hand packed cartons (pints, quarts...) to go. Around the holidays they offer their pumpkin custard which is SO fabulous. I will usually order a quart to have on for a yummy holiday treat.  Besides the pumpkin, my favorites are butter pecan, mint chip, wild cherry, peanut butter, and rocky road. My husband's "go-to" treat is the Western Special. Yeah, it's a bit spendy (@ $3.50 for a massive single scoop in a waffle cone); however, all the custard is made in-house daily with high quality ingredients. You'd spend the same, if not more, for factory-made ice cream from Cold Stone.	1
My gourmet chef father was in town and wanting a night off from cooking we were throwing around ideas of where we could take him to eat that he would approve of.  Well; since I'm pregos and I was craving Italian food and have been wanting Bootleggers we made the short drive there.  We were sat right away in the dimmed dinning room with the perfect level of music playing in the back ground.  I was so excited when they brought out their garlic knots and basil dipping sauce about 1 minute after we sat down.  We destroyed them!  And got seconds!!!  My dad perused the menu he had a smile on his face.  Not only from the menu but the great smells all around us.  I already knew what I was having, the baked Penne, always great and lots of cheese.  I love melted cheese!  Our friendly waiter took our order; my dad got Marsala and my BF got the picatta,  then he brought my dad is wine, how could you not have a nice glass of red wine with great Italian food?  If I wasn't with child, I would have had 1 or 3  myself.  The food came in a timely manner and we jumped right in!  Right after my dad's first bite he proclaimed that his Marsala was one of the best he has ever had.  Mine was amazing as always and my BF's was gone very quickly , a sign it was great as well.  Our waiter checked back with us a few time and in my dad's true fashion they struck up a conversation about, well who knows what I was engaged in my food!  All in all we left happy, full, and I with a preggo craving filled; which some of you know is most importantI Suggest anyone who loves great Italian food  with the old school feel go to bootleggers Bistro, bring the parents with you; they may like it so much they may pay! ( Thanks dad!!)	1
Had great quality when it opened but since the renovations a year or two ago the quality is below average. The selection is limited and most rolls taste identical. You can also expect to be yelling to be heard at your table due to the open layout and popularity with large groups.The review would be one star but I need to give credit for the service I received.	0
very dissapointed in this resturant.  the first time I went there I ordered a blue moon,  when I inquired about the orange slice, they brought me aglass of orange juice.   Ive gone back several times because friends that live in the neighborhood like to patronize this establishment.I attended the wilmore street festival a couple weeks ago, and all the resturants sold food, in booths. guess who ran out burger and company and the event was in their parking lot.  imagine that, others like open kitchen and pinkys set up temp kitchens in tents and the food flowed. its like they dont make the extra effort needed intodays business climate.  Last night I was invited to a birthday party there,  the party had been arranged with several meeting in person with the owner,  when the party planner showed up to start preperations she was met by the new manager and said we know nothing of your party or the fact there was a dj,  she did however know about the large food order that had been placed.  The party started and it was a very mild crowd of mainly older people who danced some, and just wanted to be with family and friends.  the bar service was teribbly slow, and finally the manager on duty very rudly shut the party down.  no effort was made on her behalf to make the event a sucess, it was already a very lucrative event for burger and company otherwise they would have been empty yet again on a sat night.  As I walked out the door,  and closed out my bar tab, that was the last one I will ever have in that establishemnt.  I will take my money elsewhere,  I felt like is was 1950 again in the way my african american friend were treated.  I was embarrassed to be white.You need to look at the new mgr you just hired as she has cost you a ton of business in her first week. as I know of atleast 30 of your regular customers will not enter your doors again..	0
Functional Performance is a clean and well equipped physical therapy clinic in Tempe. The staff are friendly, but they are overloaded with patients and give you very little attention. The owner is pretty arrogant and is very flirtatious with some of the female clients. He barely listened to me when I came in and had me continue doing exercises that I told him were causing me pain until I ended up with a bad injury from the physical therapy. Months later I am still injured and never received so much as an apology. I would never recommend Functional Performance to anyone.	0
I have taken my dogs here for ever and loved the vets and staff. My dog suddenly became very sick on a Wednesday ,morning and I knew that the office opens at 7:30am. We got there early and waited. The receptionist opened the doors on time and I struggled to get my 100lb dog into the building. My dog collapsed on the floor barely breathing and she tells me that the vet will not be in for another 30 min!!!!! Why would you open a veterinary clinic without a vet present!? I had to have someone help me get her back into the car and by this time my dogs tongue was blue. We got to emergency and she died less then an hour later. Thanks Prestige for the help on one of the worst days of my life. I hope it was worth sleeping in...	0
I ordered flowers from Springtime Floral for our 25th Vow Renewal. I orderd  Bouquets, Boutanaires. Centerpiece, Beautiful Room Flowers and Cake Flowers . The Ladies at Springtime Floral did a Beautiful job. It was beyond my expectations. Beautiful colors of flowers  and orchids. They stayed and decorated the room with Beautiful center pieces. And decorated my cake. The Bouqets were brought to us and the boutainares pined on. Our day was perfect  We had nothing to worry about.I will use Springtime Floral for all My FLower needs. Love the Ladies there and I can trust them with making my Flower Dreams come true :)	1
I like going to Dickey's.  The food is consistently good, the service is outstanding (the guys behind the counter are always friendly and gregarious), and who can hate free ice cream?  The only thing that keeps my review from being five stars is their pricing. For the portion size, they seem to be a tad bit high.  I only go when I have a 2-for-1 coupon or something like that.	1
I love hamburgers to death but if I eat them as much as I want to I would be some kind of crazed 800 lb shut in requesting that McDonald's build a drive through that goes into my mouth.  This makes me sad.    This is why I love Create.  Create has healthy alternatives to the tradition hamburger.  They have turkey burgers, portabello burgers, and veggie burgers as well as the traditional hamburger.  Man o man that is awesome.  Plus they have some of the biggest selection of toppings I have ever seen from traditional to out right wacky. The sweet potato fries are also amazing.   Plus I love spicy food and there "Atomic Sauce" is definitely one of the better spicy sauces I've ever had.  The only negative I would say is that there actual beef burger could probably use a better quality of spices because it is a little bland ( just a little).  You can easily off set this with the amazing array of topping.All in All great place!	1
This is just another store at the Miracle Mile Shops that employs lazy people that aren't earning their paycheck. I stopped in on a weekday afternoon, just browsing. The same inconsiderate employee got in my way multiple times when I was trying to browse. After she moved a cart of accessories to within 2 feet of where I was standing, blocking the items I was about to look at, I decided that shopping at H&M wasn't worth the frusteration and I took my business elsewhere.	0
Hey it was enjoyable and it was free. Nice little entertainment, the women were hot, I had to really fight the crowd but I got a really nice spot to see the action, the rest of my group not so great positioning.  I look forward to seeing this again on my next trip to las vegas.  Treasure Island casino was fun too overall.-Editors note- On my most recent trip to Vegas in 2011, only 1 night I ACTUALLY passed by the Treasure Island only when this was playing. it was horrible actually seeing this again. I only lasted for a few mins, not the whole 20 mins. I headed on the Wynn casino like I originally planned.	1
I got a full set pink and white acryllic tips for a wedding at 9:30 pm on a friday night. By time the wedding was over the next day at 4pm, my nails were already chiping at my nail bed. This place is very big and the job was done in such a quick time which is awesome however I paid $50 and in less than one day they started to chip.My nail beds were not pushed down to make my nails look nicer.  A bit disappointing considering how much I paid.My nails look like I should of got them done over a week ago and not just 3 days.  Very Very diasppointing. I wish theey looked better.	0
I stayed at this hotel with my family of 5 for the night.  We have 3 boys and they loved the room.  We had a suite that had a separate room for them.  The rooms are beautifully decorated and have big flat screens.  The pool was small, but we were the only people there so it wasn't a problem.  We skipped the hotel breakfast since there are so many great places in Madison to go to eat (Monty's).Free Wi-Fi is always nice and I was surprised by the quality of the room for the price we paid.  It's obvious the building is relatively new and it's kept in good condition.	1
I'm not your typical Vegas-goer as I don't do the club scene and am usually here for conferences.  HRH has a reputation for being pretty crazy with their Rehab party - from the looks of it, I think it certainly lived up to that reputation.  Here's a review from someone who was sober the entire time:Pools:  I think that they have the best pools in Vegas.  If you're like me, then Sunday morning is probably not the best time to go...but anytime during the week, when it's fairly empty, the pools are like a glimmering oasis of blue.  I think there's 10 or more.  I know that they close early, but I was able to walk in and dip my toes in ... I saw some people swimming so as long as you're discreet, maybe it's possible to do some pm swimming :)Food:  I only ate at Pink Taco.  Their happy hour was ridiculously cheap.  We sat at the bar and ordered one of everything (giant fatties).  They seem to do chicken the best (skewers).  I also recommend the tamales.Room:  We stayed in the Paradise Tower.  It's set further back from the hotel.  The room is very rock 'n roll - dark wall paper (very gothic) and I think the most comfortable bed...ever?  I've slept in some nice beds, but wow...after a long (make that 5 LONG days at a conference) this was a total treat.  Bathroom:  The shower was pretty big and I like that it was separate from the sinks.  Products were great - some brand, Prickly Pear (?).  Gym:  I really wanted to go...it looked very clean, small, but had a lot of equipment.  I took a star off because the resort fee does suck - especially since I didn't get to use any of the amenities.	1
I spend quite a bit of time gallivanting through the entire valley since my relocation to the desert so I've been on a one woman quest to find an affordable and pleasant nail experience. My pedicure here was very nice with a massage, hot stone, vibrating massage (er, once I got over that bit of awkwardness as the massage wand was a bit unexpected). The results were pretty, but not earth shattering. However, my manicure was one of the worst ones I have ever received. Even without touching anything and sitting patiently for my nails to dry (as they do not have the snazzy light bar to quick dry), my manicure is all bubbly and splotchy. I am not skilled with the nail art at all, but I could have done better myself at home. My nails were also filed and buffed over my pants, so my jeans looked worse for the wear after the whole experience. For $35 for a manicure and pedicure, I expect more.	0
I am a Vegas local and have stayed here on two previous occasions.  Both times were with Groupon/Living Social deals and I was very happy.Fast forward to a month ago when I purchased another Groupon for a Spa package and hotel stay.  The first time I called to book a date, I was told their reservation system was down and that a Supervisor would call me back the following day.  No call back.  I tried again a few days later and was told that they did not have the correct codes to book the Groupon.  I was also told a Supervisor would call me back.  No call back.  I again tried a few days later and was the told the same thing.  They did not have the correct Groupon codes to make a reservation?????   I was again told a Manager would be contacting me immediately.  A Manager did not call.My next call was to Groupon.  I was immediately refunded my Groupon purchase and told that others had experienced problems as well.Buyer beware.  Not sure what is going on here.  A shame really considering it is a really nice Hotel.	0
So let's get this out of the way up front: The food here's pretty good. There I said it. I always enjoy the food, there's not been one thing there that I've eaten that I didn't like. That being said, food isn't going to make me return to a place to eat. We usually get takeout from CB because their service flat out sucks. My wife made me go with her this past weekend, because I've been making her get takeout form Hula Modern Tiki the past few times (Hula's great). So against my will, and because it was on the eve of Valentine's day, I decided to cave against my better judgement. I should be totally ticked, but because they didn't fail my expectations and screwed up my meal/deliviered craptacular service, wifey won't be making me go again. Win, I think.  I always make it a point to order the dinner special from places with the idea that the chefs are sick and tired of cooking the same stuff on the menu, and will be invigorated at cooking something new and exciting. This particular night, I opted for the Miso Marinated Sea Bass. Sounds great, right? I'll never know..the server never brought it to me. Appetizer arrived, wife's meal arrived, daughter's bowl of steamed rice arrived, beer arrived, sake arrived, check arrived. Not in that order, but you get my drift. So my meal consisted of some of my wife's sushi, some of my daughter's steamed rice, some of the appetizer, beer, sake and table bread. Happy Valentines to you Cherry Blossom!  If anybody's thinking of checking this place out, get takeout. The food's good, but I can get better service at QT. (Yes, the gas station)	0
On a recent visit to Las Vegas, I visited this restaurant for lunch. Although, I wanted to enjoy the food and ambiance, I was thoroughly disappointed. The salad bar spread was limited and not as fresh as I've experienced in other Brazilian restaurants. Furthermore, the meats offered were limited and the beef offerings overcooked. Needless to say, I won't be visiting this place the next time I'm in town.On a positive note, the restaurant was clean, service was good, and the staff was friendly. Lunch prices were decent considering the spread offered.	0
New Zealand lamb and the salted caramel bread pudding. I was left grunting with happiness. Twice. Nothing more to say, except come here. More than once. Life becomes that much better when you do.	1
Terrible service, average food and high prices...!  We went late one night with a reservation and it wasn't too crowded but it took forever for our waiter to come.  Then when he did come we asked for a specific type of wine and he had no idea if they had it and had to go and check.  It took a good 10 minutes for him to come back and say yes they did have it so we went with it and placed our order about 20 minutes after sitting and waiting hungry.I had an odd goat cheese salad with flavorless breaded fryed goat cheese, 2 pieces of apples and lettuce that appeared to be the Dole bagged salad blend.  Nice iceburg and dried up shredded carrots.My husband had the lasagnae which wasn't fully cooked.  Aunt had a decent chicken parmesan and uncle had a seafood dish that he enjoyed.The absolute worst part though was where we were seated...  this place is big enough and all but we were sat right next to the kitchen door so the bright lights of the kitchen blinded me every 2 minutes when the waiters/waitress came in/out (but suprisingly never our waiter - who knows where he was!).  That wouldn't have been too bad but they kept yelling and screaming back there and dropping (or thowing - it was strange).  It was very difficult and I'm not sure I wanted to know what was going on back there.  I don't like to hear screaming coming from a kitchen!!!	0
I've been to Du-Par's in Los Angeles at the Farmers Market. Great place with great service. This Vegas location, not so much. We sat out front closest to the casino in a kinda dark eating area. After sitting down and deciding what we wanted, we waited for about 10 minutes to get our drink and food order taken. I ordered a California chicken sandwich. I hated it. The bread was toasted only on the ends which meant the rest of the bread was soggy. The chicken tasted cold and bland and the other ingredients were messy and not worthy of the price. The best thing on the plate were the french fries. My girlfriend ordered a turkey sandwich, chicken soup, and piece of pie. It was all disappointing. The bread on the sandwhich was so soggy she didn't even eat it. It grossed her out. Her soup tasted like Campbell's soup from a can. The pie was cold and not even warm or fresh. In LA, they warm the piece of pie up for you. It even took the waitress about 6 minutes to get us basic things like salt, pepper, and ketchup. Why aren't these on the table. I paid the check and told the cashier that I didn't think I would come back. The people at the table over us were also talking about how much it has changed since they came to eat here the year before. I'm not going back. Disappointing. Disgusting.	0
First, let me say that I'm not one to eat at a buffet, sorely because i lose my appetite when I see piles of foods on trays lined up from one end of the wall to another.I was forced (yes, forced!) to go here with my family - party of 8 with two toddlers. Usually, for big parties wiith messy toddlers, the host would normally sit you in the corner away from other gobbling patrons, but not our case. we were just a few feet away from the food, yet not too close from foot traffic.(that's 1 star)The buffet, being in the Orleans casino, serves southren food (among other "international theme") - from crawfish to hush puppies. They also have cooked and raw oysters. Not bad for a $20. The only drawback is the desert section - they dont have much to offer tehre. But then again, I get stuffed easily and usually dont have much room for sweet shutffs.(that's 2 stars)This is no Rio buffet, so there's really not much waiting. However, being that it was graduation week, there were a lot of locals with their graduating kids (still on their cap n gown). Stilll, we only waited for about 8 minutes.(that's 1 star)I got a bad impression of our server at first because instead of neatly placing our silverwares on the table, she would just toss it from the other end of the table, so I had to catch my fork as bouncess across the table. (that's -1 star)	1
I stayed at the Luxor Hotel and it is showing its age. The plumbing system was very noisey and the drapes were stained. The price is great for the strip however, I would rather pay more to have something nice.	0
I find it funny that some can walk in actually 10 minutes  before closing want full consultation don't you think that coming earlier would help. If you're a new patient it helps to go in a little earlier so you can get your full attention. At least that's I what did. In Pain sucks, but wanting a doctor to rush through to see sucks worse.  the age of Google look up hours and plan accordingly.	1
I really enjoy the food here. If it weren't for living so far, i would swing by more often. I like how you can crush your sesame seeds and mix it with the sauce. It doesn't seem too crazy or out of the ordinary but it adds the uniqueness of dining here. Their katsu is top knotch, good portions and very tasty. The menu isn't overwhelming and whenever I read it, it's easy to make a decision. Prices are average and actually decent for the quality and portion you receive.Staff are always welcoming and friendly. My first visit was quite enjoyable. I came here with my girflriend for a nice dinner. We sat at the "bar(don't think there is alcohol served here)" and our waiter asked if we've ever ate here. We replied "no," and he showed us what to do with the sesame seeds and sauce. We had a good time, as simple as it was. We had a fun conversation with our waiter too.Whenever I eat here, I tend to always order the chicken and shrimp katsu. yumm I haven't eaten here in a month or two and the more I think about it right now it makes me hungry.5/5 for all around good experiences for every visit and great consistent food and service.	1
This is one of the best places to watch a football game in the area, or any sport for that matter. There are daily deals, and specials that are offered, which make them different than a lot of the overpriced sports bars across Arizona. Not everyone is upper-middle class or in the 1%, so it's great to see that value is taken into account with their pricing, as well as consideration to the everyday man's wallet. $6 wings during happy hour during the week?! Need I say more? Yes, I actually do, because this bar won an award for best wings in the Phoenix Times (try their unique sweet style--none like them). However, they offer a lot more than that fooodwise, and the portions are wonderful. When you order a salad, you get a REAL salad, and can even feel a little satisfied after the darn thing. When you order a ZIPP's burger, you get a REAL burger. When you order a...well, I think you get the idea.All that rambling, and I didn't even talk about the service! Wow. Shame on me, but it's surprising in this era of lack of customer service and manners, to find a place that values its customers, and treats them like so, in the establishment itself. I've been here many times, and I've never been disappointed. If by chance you have, or had a bad experience, give it a second shot. The place is well run, VERY CLEAN, and opening multiple locations for a reason. :)5 stars if ya add grilled wings option :)	1
Prices at mad pita are pretty cool, the service is great, there's fishes floating around in vases on the table...And...my gyro meat wasn't roasted and carved off the spit how I like it :(Gyro meat is in strips and fried on a skillet top; not how I prefer. The lettuce and veggies were fresh, the tzatziki sauce was yummy as was the feta, but the meat and boring pita killed my gyro experience. Boyfriend got the falafel, he said it was yummy, overall more satisfying than my meal (as usual).Not sure if we will head back for round 2...I need my satisfying gyro fix! I ordered the baklava for dessert, it was a little different than the traditional Greek style I have had before. Really buttery but otherwise a little bland.	0
We stumbled upon Sweetlix while visiting Pittsburgh. It's a self-serve froyo place. The froyo wasn't very tarty and they had very limited topping choices. And the toppings they DID offer were lacking. There was hardly any fruit in the bins and the guy working the counter was too preoccupied with other things (non work related it seemed) to fill the toppings even thought I was scraping out the last of the strawberries. There also weren't any places to sit. There were tables that you could stand at but no stools or chairs.	0
Ok, let us sum up what you get from the 11\u00a3 you pay for this tour:a tedious short walk in boring roads of the old town with loads of stops in which you have to listen to tacky stories with the guide shouting every now and then trying to scare you (if I lived in the old town I'd report this to the police), then you enter in the so called vaults, and what you get to see are:1) A narrow and rotting staircase2) Two cellar rooms with a bumpy floor2) a corridor3) a narrow cellar room in which you are told about a lady on a tour who heard whispers coming from the backwall.Not much indeed. The time is filled up by the awkwardly tacky story-tellingThe underground rooms are but a cellar. I am from Italy and most italian buildings have cellars which look complitely identical, with the sole exception of salami and wine which here were absent.They spend some time telling you that people used to spend time there and that they found oyster shells which might indicate that the room was a tavern of some sort, but the whole thing is rather pathetic. 3 minutes would be too much to take a look at what is there to see. They show many stories underground in boards and posters giving the impression that you actually get to explore a complex system of underground tunnels and rooms, but then you only get to see three rooms and a corridor.Obviously we complained and the manager was hiding behind the good reviews. Oh dear, a bunch of hyped-up tourists giving 5 stars to everything they've done is hardly an excuse to rip people off in this way.\u00a32.50 would be an adequate price, and without the time-filler, I mean the tacky storytelling.Strongly advise you not to go on ANY tour of this kind.	0
Moooo.  Like cattle, we line up to go through the line and get on the plane.  In the past, there was mauling and gnashing of teeth to see who could be at the front of the 'A' line, and then a senior citizen or parent with 4 kids would snag the exit row because they were allowed to pre-board (even though legally they're not supposed to sit in the exit row if they're so old that they need extra time to get a seat, or if a parent watching kids).  My only consolation is seeing how irate the families get now that their precious "family boarding" is after the 'A' group, making them have to push and shove with the rest of us, and fight to the death for precious overhead space.We don't have a fist-fight at the front of the 'A' line any longer.  Instead, there are a bunch of pathetic people who sit in front of their computer and wait until exactly 24 hours before the flight to log on and claim their 'A' boarding pass.  What is amusing is that I tried this once, at exactly the 24 hour limit, and yet I'm somehow #33 in the 'A' group.  Way to go Southwest - eliminate once crazy line and create another.Stewards and Stewardesses are dressed casual, make jokes that are marginally funny at best, and have ruined air travel for the rest of us on other airlines because so many people are accustomed to behaving and dressing however they want on a flight.  Oh God, bring back the days when air travel was a luxury, and the bus people took the bus (or Amtrak, for that matter).  Southwest is truly the Wal-Mart of airlines, and has impacted the air travel industry negatively for who knows how long.	0
Room: We were put in a room on the 3rd floor all the day at the end of the hallway facing the highway. I am pregnant and a light sleeper and that wasn't gonna suffice.  So I called the front desk where they told me my only other option was a 2 queen bed room, no more kings.  Hard to believe because the resort seemed deserted.  But we took it.  That was annoying. Also, in both rooms we were in, the mini bar price list was completely out of date.  There were several items on both mini bars that were not even listed on the list.  I wanted these items but had no idea I would be bogusly charged for them so I didn't indulge.  Disappointing. The powering washing each night of the pool area, VERY obnoxious.  Can this not be done after the pool closes when everyone is at dinner?  1. I could hear it from our room when we went to bed early. 2. The next night we went to the hot tub and they were power washing all around us and it was very obnoxious and loud.  Terrible. Next, the steakhouse experience.  VERY disappointed in how that turned out. Also, our last morning my husband went down to starbucks to get my an ice water.  He also ordered himself a coffee but he forgot his ID/wallet because he was just going to do a room charge.  We stayed at The Aria the 2 nights prior to coming here and didn't need our ID's for the room charges.  So we weren't used to it.  Well he didn't have his ID so he just asked them for the water for his pregnant wife and to forget the coffee.  They said no because the water was $.27, not free.  Are you kidding me?!  The resort can't spare $.27 as a courtesy to this EXTREME INCONVENIENCE after  a 10-15 minute round trip walk?  So he had to walk all the way back up to our room for his ID just to get me water.  He even asked if he could txt me and ask me to send a picture of his ID to show the cashier and he said no.  How absurd.  All for $.27 for the pregnant lady.	0
Best Bananas around. Big ,delicious frozen bananas fresh dipped and rolled in nuts! Found at fairs, craft marts and festivals.  Prices are reasonable and they are fresh dipped in front of you. High Quality chocolate makes this my favorite!	1
This was our first time to a interactive theatre event and it was a blast.  We have been to may theatre shows but to be so close and intimate with the actors was truly a great experience.  Our night had a great audience who were all into the event.  We all had upgraded food items and were good for a chain restaurant like coco's and added pleasantly to our experience.  We cannot wait to go again and will be inviting many more friends to join us.	1
This was our first time here and it was a great time! We ordered the Vegas fries & Fireball Whiskey Wings and they were delicious! We were served by Dan and he was on point so give his section a try. We washed it all down the Guido's Freaky Tiki. Give this place a shot and you won't be sorry.	1
Good start to our trip.T&T was our first meal in Vegas after checking in to the Luxor.  Reviews were a little low, so we hadn't planned on eating here, but we wanted something quick and convenient and gave it a try.  We started with an order of guacamole which seemed freshly made and was very good (large portion was more than my wife and I could finish with a meal).  The salsas that came with our chips was also good - chipotle and verde.I ordered the combos tacos, which came with barbacoa, carnitas, and chicken.   They were very good and really had a lot of flavor (the chicken seemed bland next to the others).  My wife ordered a different variety of pork tacos which were very good also.The only negative was that the beans and rice that came with our meals were a little dry and bland.Overall, we enjoyed the experience and atmosphere.  I would recommend to anyone staying in the Luxor looking for an easy meal.	1
Not only is the food delicious but the service was amazing! We ordered the meat and cheese platter with a caprese salad. It was the perfect combination for a hot night. We took our time, enjoyed the food and we never felt rushed. Now it's your turn!	1
Je fais livrer la pizza depuis longtemps, la pate est succulante moilleuse et croustillante en meme temps, il y a une tonne de garniture, le fromage coule! C'est une pizza qui ne se mange pas sur le pousse. En plus, c'est des gros morceaux de vrai bacon...C'est sure que c'est peut-etre plus cher qu'une pizzeria commerciale, mais tu en as plus et de la qualite en plus. Les sous-marins aussi sont bons et la poutine est tres surprenante en livraison. Encore la une tonne de fromage et des frites croustillantes!	1
all kinds of great sandwiches and pasta and desserts its like something from back east	1
First of all I feel scammed here.  Why didn't I read the Yelp reviews beforehand?   I would have avoided this place like the plague. We got a fast talking rep at the counter, Carmen.I gave her a copy of my Costco Travel rental car reservation.  Whenever I rent a car I always decline additional insurance as I've got AAA insurance which I specifically told her.  Carmen is fast talking during the entire transaction and says we must have minimum insurance coverage.  Oh, o.k.  Not knowing we are paying additional $26 more each day.   She says sign here and here on a digital tablet, and we do.It wasn't until she hands us a hard copy of the rental agreement and we look at it later that we see the additional charge.  I ask if we can we get it back, and she just giggles.Avoid Budget at all cost.   Unscrupulous business practices.  We ended up paying an additional $104.00.Subsequently I wrote an email to customer service disputing the $104.00.  Of course the rep sides with Carmen based on the written agreement that we agreed to optional liability insurance.   Sign here, and sign here on a small digital screen doesn't allow the consumer to read it in total.  Too bad for Budget as they've lost what could have been a repeat customer.	0
Great food. Everytime I have been hear I have really enjoyed it. Great food pairings. It is expensive but there are some reasonable options next to the 30 dollar fish.  I have made it out for my last two birthdays in Madison. My father ate the rainbow trout here a year or so ago and said it was the second best meal he has ever eaten, the first being the space needle.	1
I'm in shopping heaven!! Usually I'm a little skeptical about going to the outlets. It's just overwhelming and I usually am dissatisfied. We were in Vegas for the Turkey Holiday and we decided to go Black Friday shopping at this outlet. Oh jeez, parking was a nightmare. Hubs just shoved me out of the car so I could shop and he drove off to find parking. So many stores! Where to begin?? Just start walking. This place was so crowded, but it got me excited because there were so many great stores here. Much better than the ones back home in Cali. Kate Spade, Coach, Michael Kors, Columbia, so many more!! All my money went here instead of the casinos. Make sure to stop by before you leave.	1
Well I went to school here and loved it and I feel like I got a great education. It may be huge but once you find your niche you will do just fine! You just have to make sure you go to class and take good notes because most classes are so huge they won't harass you to come, yet just expect you to! I loved the Big Ten games and the energy of the campus. I would never have picked a different place to spend four years!	1
Service was slow.  7 rolls came out one at a time over the course of 45 minutes so that no one really ate together.  At the end, a gratuity was automatically added.  We had a party of 5.  Never heard of an automatic gratuity for a party of 5, but then again, I have never had worse service.	0
I came sorta unknowingly because me and bf were meeting up with his fam.  We were seated near the bar and there were tons of TVs everywhere and lots of enthusiastic sports fans.  The beer list is super extensive and the food seemed pretty expensive... but hey it's Vegas.  I wanted the Epic without Fermentation beer under their seasonals but I guess they were out so the server recommended the St. Bernardus.  It was really strong for me, but it's ok I ordered it.  I wasn't too hungry and ordered the junk chips based on yelpers suggestions and the other party ordered fried pickles.  From looking at the only pic on yelp of the junk chips, my chips didn't really look like that.  The chips on the yelp pic looks even spread, but when my junk chips came out the BBQ ragu was only like at the bottom chips and the bleu cheese was uneven and then like a lump of  scallions on the very top chip.  As far as the flavors, the housemade chips were like thicker lays BBQ chips and I felt they were pretty salty and sweet which didn't compliment the overpowering flavors of the BBQ ragu and the bleu cheese.  I don't know.  Just not my favorite.The fried pickles were good.  They were just thin/thick enough with a nice coating.  It came with 3 dipping sauces which were a housemade ketchup, sirracha ranch that was pretty spicy, and a bleu cheese dip.  Overall I wouldn't make it a point to come here for lunch/dinner but maybe a quick (expensive) snack because it was a nice place to relax.	0
I haven't been here in awhile and made a stop in last night.  Apparently this has turned into a smoking bar.  I find this odd since they also serve food (the kitchen hadn't closed yet) and I thought that was against the law.  This place reeks of cigarette and cigar smoke, so I will not be returning.  The service wasn't that great either.	0
WOW! Where to begin. . . was it just me or was everyone else dazed afterwards? Lol I couldn't for the life of me figure out what the theme of this production was, other than it's a water show. There was no rhythm or reason to each of the scenes (like the scuba people), but each scene kept your eyes busy that's for sure. My all time favorite were the 3 contortionists and that's all I'm going to say because you just have to see it to believe it! The big boat was exciting, but I don't know, I wanted more flying and swing. The music was good but the musician were in this costume above us and I think they were trying to dress like a ghost? Anyway kind of weirded me out, among other weird dead like props and costumes. If I had to pick one act to see more it would have been the clowns! They were hilarious and I loved the comic relief between all the intense acts. By the way even if you brought tickets outside of the splash zone you could still get drizzled on, but nothing to wear a rain coat to. Also these tickets were way more than all the other Cirque du Soleil shows, but not sure if it's really worth it. It was a huge production so I understand why they had to charge as much as they did. But a lot of the acts were just extra because I only have one pair of eyes and I can only process so much at one time and it was a huge stage 8-) Not sure if I would want to see it again, but I'm glad I saw it.	1
I love how this theatre is close to everything, but you can always find a parking spot and the theatre is never crowded. I just wish they (and all other movie theatres) would show movies at 8pm instead of 7 and 9.	1
we had a huge group and we couldn't get into my first choice, RAKU. so we decided to come here instead, which I've already been to before, and enjoyed, on a separate occasion. tapas and sangria were enjoyed by all, especially the bacon wrapped dates, the mac and cheese, the filet mignon sliders, the lamb skewers, the thai beef salad. some people will be like, oh is this place authentic? blah blah. well, it's better than some food I had in barcelona, if that answers your question, and I had some food in spain that could never be beat by anything stateside. Who cares? It tastes good and you'll have fun, but make sure you get the sangria.	1
Much hype for the chocolate man. Although I'm not a big chocolate person, I figured... I was in Vegas! I'll give it a shot.Because I was unwilling to spend too much money for the food, I chose to get 2 small sliders. I don't remember what they were, but they were just generic sliders. Nothing spectacular.I tried the waffle smothered in chocolate and chocolate bits and ice cream. Syrup Desserts in DTLA is way, way better. All I tasted was chocolate, but no real flavor. The waffle was... bland and lacking.	0
Un resto qui engage une serveuse qui ne comprend pas un mot de francais, c'est irrespectueux et innaceptable \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al. Et c'est tout ce que j'ai \u00e0 dire sur ce resto car il n'a pas eu un rond de moi!	0
As a city, Charlotte walks a rather thick line between offering chain & indie options, so it's nice to see a small establishment thrive.  However, the Manor Theater IS a Regal property, so I don't know how "indie" it truly is.  That being said, the Manor definitely captures the feel of a small arthouse, and it's great that we have this option.  With only two screens (hence, "Twin"), there's none of the bells and whistles you would normally find at a movieplex: stadium seating, automated ticket machines, or more than two bathroom stalls.  Parking is a bit scarce, as they share a lot with Panera and other businesses, but you can usually find a space around the side or in back.  What you will find is the smell of old movie popcorn, cozy red velvet seats, and a place to see great smaller-budget films.  We're lucky to have a movie theater with a bit of the old magic still left in her.	1
I really love this store! This pet store really cares about customer service to the fullest. I was interested in a certain flavor of Nature's Variety in the medium size bag and they only had Lamb and Oatmeal in the smaller bag. Because they pride themselves on customer service they discounted the smaller bag for me because of the inconvenience and ordered me the medium bag that they are also giving me a discount on. I THINK THAT IS AWESOME! They also donate any returned bags of food the the animal shelter and I think that is pretty amazing :)	1
This place is a dump and that is a compliment for the neighborhood it's located in.  If you have a fear of being mugged, shot, or raped then stay away...and I mean during daylight hours too! This place makes prison look like Club Med.  Too bad I had to chose a star or I would have rated it "no stars".	0
We went to the location to purchase a bow tie and the store was closed early, which was less than ideal because we specifically hurried over there for an urgent need. We ended up going back the next day, and the attendant was very helpful. But closing the store earlier than posted hours leaves me to leave only two stars on this review.	0
I would give a 5, but it's pricey and definitely a treat type of dessert.We have enjoyed all their natural tasting flavored paletas.  My favorite is the pecan/nuez!!Love that they're in tempe, I use to travel to chandler.  And they sell a cooler you can buy and store your paletas in for traveling home in the AZ heat.Way better than the paletero who use to pass by my house when I was little, but just more expensive :(  Although, I do love to think of that jingle and running screaming "STOP!!"	1
I wish I had better things to say, BUT we won't ever return here. And thats with 25 dollar rooms.It's the smokiest casino that I've walked through in Vegas and left us feeling ill from breathing it in each time we walked to and from our room.	0
We stopped in here for a late lunch after touring the Capitol.  They had a 51 beers on tap (!!) and close to 100 in bottles.  We tried a local beer and ordered some grub.  The food (salad for me), was fine but nothing special.  The location of the restaurant and all the beers on tap (along with the ambience) definitely makes up for the food.	1
We always enjoy coming to this casino once a year for a little bit of fun. I always end up on the slot machines while the hubs will play a round of poker. The only thing that confuses me is that in Vegas there are waitresses walking around getting you drinks. I have not seen that here and don't know if they even do it. We can still have fun even if we're not drinking, though. ;)	1
the only reason this bar didn't get 5 stars is because its a boston bar and i hate boston with a firey passion.  knowing this, you should conclude that this place ROCKS IN EVERY OTHER ASPECT, since it got the most stars allowable with the minus one for the boston garb haha.  hubs and i went to this bar because they had satellite and so they had the ability to play all the baseball games when we were visiting az.  they were happy to put on the angels game for us-yey!  the bartender was a totally chill guy, even gave the hubs a smoke.  and the cook ROCKED !! she was so sweet and she was an angels fan so she came out and kicked it with us.  she even bought us each a shot!! and their prices are greeeeaaat!  its a small place, with great food, and great people.  you can't go wrong at baer's!  (boston sux)	1
Now here's a good place.I didn't want to eat here; fish restaurant, weird location from my hotel, looked too trendy to have good food. I was wrong. Great meal.We showed up with more in our party than in our reservation. "No problem, just a minute to set up new tables." Cool.I don't drink but we had a party of 12 and those that had cocktails loved them. There was the LV-usual menu of house cocktails.  The bartender was accommodating, but when one of our party wanted a house specialty without an ingredient, the waitress came back and explained that the bartender felt the drink wouldn't be enjoyable and would she like something different? She would and she did. They were good.I ordered an appetizer and then I asked the waiter for his opinion of a dish. He said that if I liked {my appetizer} then I would really like (his suggestion). OK, I'll try it. Wait staff is young and smart. Not too chatty, but if you engage them, they'll talk. Just the right amount. They were quick, accommodating and professional.I had the lump crab cocktail and steak Oscar, both very excellant. I should have had the steak cooked more than medium, but that was my fault. I didn't mention it, but I think if I did, they would have helped me out. I got that vibe off them.Dessert was chocolate something and good. Coffee came with biscotti and were yummy.Not inexpensive, but I got value, I think. Cool place, up-scale and comfortable. Not over-the-top good enough to be 5 star but getting close. I'll go back.	1
Anyone who is looking to volunteer in Las Vegas, start here. The staff is very friendly.  I just had my first experience at their dinner service. It is very organized, clean,  and those who are in need are very gracious and friendly as well. Will definitely continue to volunteer here, they do great work and have established meaningful relationships with those in need.	1
Ok let me start by saying that I've always loved Grazie and think the pizza is delicious and authentic to pizzas you can find in Naples, but over the years this place has just flat out gone down hill. Went there on a Saturday night and the place was fairly empty, which is odd since it's in old town Scottsdale. The pizza we ordered (just a basic margarita) took 45 minutes to arrive and to top it off, it was undercooked. This is when things got interesting. We told the waitress that the pizza was bad and she informed us that the pizza cook had gotten so drunk that they had to send him home so out pizza had been cooked by the salad prepper. She then offered to take half off the pizza. We were upset, but by this point were also kind of amused by it all and honestly appreciated the girls honesty. As we were leaving we noticed the owner sitting at the bar watching football. He didn't even acknowledge us. You would think in a restaurant that is clearly struggling (empty on a otherwise busy Saturday night) that the owner would have at least tried to do some damage control and talk to us. But no. He clearly doesn't care if his own restaurant succeeds or fails. So why should we? So with that we won't be back again. Which is sad cause it's been a fave of mine for past 5 years.	0
We had a pretty bad experience. A couple of things were the cause:1. Ordered a burger with fried pickles on it, but then when we got our order we got an order of fried pickles and were charged for them. We got our money back, but they still charged for the pickles on the burger and didn't apologize. 2. Bacon cheeseburger didn't have cheese on it when I got it. Pretty weird. 3. Food was something we could have made at home. Fries had almost no seasoning. We were just unimpressed with this place. We went be going again and wouldn't recommend it.	0
Fast great food. Amazing friendly staff. Delicious cookies! Will return and recommend.	1
This place is really great for teriyaki.  In fact it is really the only place worth going for teriyaki.  First of all - it is really very inexpensive (lunch for two under 20 - easily). Second of all - the service is great because it is family run - you see the same people there everytime.  The food is really good - and just hits the spot when you have a hankering for teriyaki.  My only complaint would be the hours- bums me out when I want teriyaki for dinner and they are already closed.	1
Owner wrote me and asked me to actually give his business another chance, said he was a new owner and proprietor that had taken over.	1
Let me preface this review with the fact that I'm Chinese and I know my rice.So after a meeting next door @ Hava Jave (review for that place to follow) a friend and I wandered over to Zen32 for a 10pm snack.Boy was that a mistake.  I normally eat up at Celsius in Desert Ridge so I thought I'd get the same food down here to compare.  A couple of the rolls we ordered:Viva Vegas RollCaterpillar RollThe service was just fine but honestly, even if I had Angelina Jolie serving the food naked, the food would still be crap and the rating would still be an UNO star.The rice seemed like it was day-old rice.  It was clumpy and honestly, I don't know how a sushi chef  takes CLUMPY rice and puts it into a roll...  so anyway, due to the clumpiness of the rice, the Vegas roll was loosly rolled so it fell apart when I tried to pick it up.The Caterpillar roll tasted super bland which is VERY hard to do because it includes so many different ingredients like eel, faux crab, avocado, cucumber, and eel sauce.  Not only did it taste bland, it was also poorly rolled.  Again, the service was nice but you might want to bring your own sushi if you're going to eat here...	0
Wow, four months is a long time to go without hitting these great Vegas Buffets, so Robyn N., Mike C. & I made an emergency run up here to hit a few more of them & Day One was Mandalay Bay here.Now if you're a cheapo such as myself, the trick is to arrive a little before 11 AM & get the lower breakfast price while enjoying the expanded choice of treats that the breakfast & lunch Buffets combined offer!  In this case, we arrived a little after 11 AM so the admission fee was $19.99.The atmosphere here is lovely, with the "Bay" sort of wrapping around the restaurant & it's pleasant to view through the wrap-around glass.  The place is nice inside & our table service was excellent.  It's a bit hard to be sure you have gotten to all of the serving tables, as they are somewhat scattered about the place but the food is very good & this would be the very best Buffet in almost any other city in the world!  Here, it came in ahead of Harrah's for me, because it's up to date in style, but it wasn't "incredible", which is getting to be the norm here in Vegas!	1
horrid service, cold, bland tasteless food.  the sausage gravy was so disgusting!	0
Sassy Glasses has one thing going for it; frame selection. If there is another place in Phoenix that has comparable frame selection I am unaware of it. Sassy Glasses falls short everywhere else however. The problem is Sassy Glasses is just a middle man. They do not make their own lenses, nor do they have their own doctors. And their optometry knowledge is, to say the least, limited. They are good at helping you find the right style, but the doctors they send you to are sub par and if there is a problem with your lenses you will not be able to deal directly with the lens makers. The bottom line is Sassy Glasses is good for people with minor vision issues who want to look "hip" in their glasses, but people who need serious optometry services should look elsewhere.	0
I bought the discounted oil changes from a guy who came door-to-door because they are right around the corner. First oil change was ok, took several hours because they wanted to call me and sell me brakes and didn't put it all back together, so I had to wait for that.Second oil change my wife took her truck in, I wasn't there.When I planned to go in for the third oil change, my wife told me to make sure I give them the wheel lock key so they can rotate the tires. Last time she was in, they called to ask her if they could break the wheel locks because she didn't leave them the key. She told them ok, and they charged her $25.Only problem is... WE HAVE NEVER HAD WHEEL LOCKS ON ANY OF OUR VEHICLES!!!!! She suspected something when she went to pick it up, because the counter guy was on the phone with another customer telling them the same thing about the wheel locks, but she didn't check with me.So. they will lie for $25, I will NEVER go back to Tire Works again.Just sayin..	0
Not too bad after a night of partying. I went here around 2 a.m.  There was a line, but it progressed quickly. The sirloin burger was accurate to my order.  I expected the burger to be a little bigger... The fried were hot. It's fast food (that I don't need) so what else can I say?!	1
I have been to Vegas many times and this was by far one of the worst hotels you can stay at in Vegas! The only reason I'm giving it any stars is because the bed and pillows were nice. That's about it. I have a very long list of what went wrong for my fun 30th Birthday weekend.First, most of the outlets in the room didn't work. There was no lights in the bathroom and the phone didn't work. Also, we had no toilet paper in the room and when we called to have them come fix everything and bring toilet paper. No one ever showed up. I had to go to the front desk and ask them to send us toilet paper. When it came time to dine at Mr. Lucky's for breakfast, it took about an hour and a half for our food to come. The customer service in this hotel was so bad. I couldn't believe it.When it came time to go to the pool. The first made us get in line with everyone else. Then they told us guest had to use another door. We walked all the way across the casino to be told we had to go back and get wrist bands. Then we did and they wouldn't let us in that door with our bags of sunscreen. We asked the front desk what door hotel guest had to go to and they sent us to do door that was not letting anyone in the pool. Finally we find the right door after about 1 hour of trying to figure it out and by the time we go to the pool there was NO place to sit. They told us we could get a cabana for an additional $500. I asked for the manager and when the pool manager came over, I told him I wanted to speak with the hotel manager and he told me he couldn't call her. I had to get up, walk all the way across the casino again and wait about 30min to speak with her. She did give us $200 towards our cabana, but we still paid $300. I couldn't believe it. Although, Dino at the pool is AMAZING and he was the only one that felt bad about what was going on and took some stress off of us.All in all, it was very stressful and everyone in my party was getting upset. We spent a good $10,000 on everything there and should never have been treated the way we were treated. I will never stay or even go to this place again, no will I ever use any Hard Rock for work or personal use again. There are much better Hotels in Vegas!	0
Waited over 30 minutes for our food. Was it worth it? Nope. Food didn't have any taste I had to season myself.  I don't think I wanna come back again. Poor server was really nice. But What's up with the kitchen? What a shame.	0
worst buffet for this price	0
This is my go to late night place. With $5.99 Steak and eggs you can't go wrong, plus I like playing poker there and can use my hourly comps to pay for my dinner (which is always a plus).I have never ordered anything off the menu, some others have and everything looked decent, but with 2 eggs over easy, hashbrowns, white toast and a medium rare steak for $5.99 (from11p-11a), why order anything else.The service is usually pretty quick and if you order the special it's usually out pretty fast.The first time I had it the steak was a little iffy, but the last few times it has been spot on. The only thing holding this from being 5 stars is the wait for a seat, I know you are busy and I know you want us to go and gamble in the casino, but really 45 mins for a table for 1...you have to be kidding me give me a chair in the corner and I'll be happy	1
This restaurant won't be around long. The food was decent, but the service was horrible--as was the attitude of the owner/chef. Drinks from the bar came out one at a time. Who does that? We had to ask for silverware with every course--they seemed to think we'd eat with our hands. When asked what was good? The server had no answer except to say they are known for their chef. He didn't offer dessert. When we asked for it, they didn't follow up with coffee or tea. WIth only 15 tables, the chef/owner could have said hello or stopped by the table. We were the last ones to leave (at 10 p.m.) and the chef was just sitting at a table talking to the servers. What a missed opportunity to interact with their customers.  The four of us hold higher level positions that require entertaining clients. He lost our future business. There are too many other great restaurants in Phoenix to try. Go elsewhere.	0
Now I know why this was featured on every travel site about Pittsburgh. It's what is known in the trade as "tourist trap." Surely Pittsburgh could have come up with a more original way to showcase its riverfront and the Clinton Furnace than importing Chicago's chains: Joe's Crab Shack, Bar Louie, Houlihan's. The only local restaurants were, unfortunately, closed during our visit, so we were forced to eat at the Hard Rock Cafe. What could we do? There was nothing around for at least a mile after we took the inclines. My children enjoyed the fountain, but I couldn't wait to leave.	0
These people are rude, incompetent, untimely, and unprofessional.  The repairman sent out recently was cursing in front of my kids while trying to repair my dishwasher.  He clearly was clueless as to what he was doing.  He then proceeded to tell my what an idiot I was for purchasing the other appliances I have, saying I didn't have a clue about quality.  I would run as fast as you can from this company!!	0
Awful. I'm embarrassed for the performers and TI who call this a show.	0
This place is outstanding! Great deal for french country bistro food. Very reasonable pricing, $20 for 3 course menu or order a la carte even cheaper.I am the youngest person in there by about 40 years every time I go but I don't care, I don't know anywhere else in the valley that has the same combo of charm, service, food quality, and cheap prices as this place. Is the food culinary magic? NO, but who would expect it to be at $20 for 3 courses?  Are portions huge? NO, but you can't even get out of cheesecake factory at that price (not that I'd want 3 courses at cheesecake, but you get the idea...).Unfortunately word is getting out and it is getting more and more crowded every time I go!! Great part is they will sometimes allow overflow to sit in one of the actual Vincent's dining rooms which instantly expands seating!	1
If you're coming to watch a UFC fight get there before 4pm so you're not charged the cover. Otherwise if you come anytime after 6pm you will be charged $5 unless it's a free showing on FX.Ask for your check early on these days as it will take awhile. Last time I was there it took about 20 minutes to get the check & another 10 to get it back. Every visit I've had the service is slower than it should be, but because of the fight I realize this. My recommendation is to sit at the bar. You can get full service of food & drink just as you could in a booth. The bartenders are on top of their game at this location, where as the servers not so much.The food is average, nothing to write home about, but this location has a great view	0
Deana is an awesome hair stylist!! I have for years drove 3 hrs to have my hair done!! She is flexible with her hours and fit me in last min I a Friday afternoon!! Even as messed up and dry as my hair was she fixed it and made me look beautiful again!! I would recommend her to anyone!!!	1
Great hospital the nurses were the best.  Our daughter was born here recently and we have no complaints.  I do wish the Mongolian BBQ that is offered in the cafeteria was better though.  It was prepared with the thinnest single slice of lunch meat chicken and then after a few bites I found it so unappetizing that I just threw it away.  But you don't go to a hospital for the food, and that's why I rate it five stars.	1
Never thought I would ever say this.but I have found fish tacos as good as the ones I grew up with in California. Cabo is a fun and cool hangout in an already cool and eclectic NoDa neighborhood. 4 stars because my wife was not a fan of their margaritas, but if you are in downtown Charlotte pop over to this place, it's worth the wait	1
I wanted something more than your typical Panda Express food. I wanted something new so I headed to Wendy's Noodle Cafe after I read the numerous reviews. While I was reading through the reviews the Mushroom Noodles , Beef and Tomato Rice, and the Chicken Wings stood out so I ordered them. The servings were more than enough for two.The Mushroom noodles had too much of a pronounced mushroom taste for me. Don't get me wrong I love mushrooms but after a certain point I get nauseated. These tasted better the next day with a dash of Siracha. The Beef and Tomato Rice was delicious! It's like nothing I've tasted before. It had tender pieces of beef with tomato gravy over rice. I would come back just for that dish alone. The Crispy Chicken was nice and crunchy just the way I like it! They are the best wings I've had in Vegas at an Asian food place. I wanted to be adventurous so I tried the Durian Crepe. When I was ordering I forgot that it was known as "the stinky fruit". The creme inside of it was good but when the waitress kept saying I was brave to try the Durian because many people think it smells. I started to see why after two bites. If I could compare it to anything I would compare it to garlic. The taste was very potent . If you are on a date don't order this. The food was tasty and different and the service is friendly!	1
This is a rundown on the hotel as I did not play in the casino or bars.  I stayed in a "Hollywood Hip" room.  Absolutely nothing special about this hotel - run of the mill.  You will get nothing more than the room for your money.$14 for internet connection in room$25 to use the fitness room?  That is only a $10 discount for hotel guests.Shower in adjacent room made so much pipe noise there was no sleeping past 6:00 am.Lighting in rooms is dingy.  Not even a makeup mirror.Could not get a late check out even on a Tuesday morning with no big events going on.When are they going to make in-room safes big enough to fit a 15 inch laptop?Mall adjacent has lots of stores but not as nice and not as simple to navigate as Caesar's Mall.  The best thing was the fella that stored my luggage.  He looked me in the eye and assured me my luggage would be kept safe.  I'm one for two - lost sleep but no lost luggage..	0
I ordered fish and chips. My girlfriend ordered a smoke stack. Everything was pretty bland, the food was cold but we were in a large group. The chili cheese fries were tasted like they didn't season it at all. Overall I wouldn't come here to eat anything, the drinks were good and so was the service.	0
I was so excited to try this place, such great reviews.  As soon as we got there the excitement turned to disappointment.  My husband and I decided on a last minute date night when I get off work.  I had been looking at this on yelp and it was on my list.  We went last night, Sunday, and got there about 8 pm (they closed at 9 pm).First we walked in, was not sure where to go since it was out first time.  Someone walked by and said the hostess will be back in a few minutes.  So we waited..and waited.  About 15 minutes later a hostess arrived.  We asked to be seated outside since it was beautiful out.  She was annoyed that the table she sat us at was directly against a bench which I kept hitting my elbow on.  We asked to move (there were a lot of tables) which annoyed her even more.  About 15 minutes later our server showed up (granted now the close in 30 minutes).  We asked for a cup of ice and lemons for our water multiple times...never saw those the whole meal.  She came to the table for our order and stated they only had 4 pizza's left so if we wanted pizza we needed to order immediately.  Since we had never been there, looking at the menu for 3-4 minutes was not enough time, but we wanted pizza.  We got a pepperoni like pizza and a sausage and potato white pizza.  We also ordered calamari as a appetizer.  When the food came out, all of it came at once.  This is my biggest pet peeve of restaurants!!  Appetizers come before a meal...not with it!  The calamari was nothing to talk about...frozen and bland.  The best thing about it was that we got the lemons with is, so we used those in our water.  The pizzas came out at the same time...again nothing great.  The crust was actually delicious, but there was hardly any cheese on them at all.  We asked for parm cheese, never got that either.  On the potato pizza the potatoes were still hard (under cooked) so we peeled them all off.  The pepperoni was okay, just needed more cheese.  The crust was the best part of the pizza.  The food was okay...the service was horrible (never got what we asked for, drinks empty whole meal, and rushed to get everything since it was close to closing).  I think with this experience we will not come back here.  We drove over 30 minutes to try this place and it was a disappointment.  I know there are a lot of good reviews, but this is my view, which is not great.	0
Wandering through First Friday, I was craving somethin' sweet. Not having tried Sweet Republic before I was intrigued by their lil'bus. As I stood back to read the menu I was intrigued by what I saw...I [heart] bacon.sweet salted caramel.mmmmmm. Always looking to try something new and always down for caramel I was torn on which one to choose...the Universe provided me with my answer as a man in front of me orders a double with a scoop of the I [heart] bacon and the caramel.[Thank You].I decided on the same! The bacon was a rich creamy sweet cream base with these small bits of slightly salty, slightly sugary, slightly smokey bacon morsels. Kind of reminded me of a toasted candied pecans and salted peanuts on my ice cream but BETTER. Come on people it is bacon we're talking about here!! WOW! Totally not what I expected! The Salted caramel, was very good also but relative to what I paired it up to it was mild by comparison. Also I am kind of spoiled by the occasional treat of Hagen daz's Signature Fleur de Sel Caramel ice cream with mini chocolate caved Salted caramels. Ooh MY Goodness's* sooooo good. It's been a week and I can still remember that flavor like it was yesterday's folks I [heart] bacon!	1
The is probably one the worst places to eat.  As i walked into this place I assumed it was going to be a good resturant to eat at.  The resturant was big and clean.  My family of 4 ordered 3 Pho Dac Biet and one Bun Chao Tom (grilled shimp past with noodles).  When our Pho came out it was warm.  It wasn't hot enough to cook the raw meat then put on top of pho.   The worst part of the meal was when the Bun Chao Tom.   As we were slicing into the meat we discovery that it was still cold.  We were completely disgusted at this point.  We paid and left.  We will never return to this place again.	0
Findlay Honda used to be a great place to buy a car they treated you like a person not a sale. Definitely can't say that now. Started the process of buying a car Friday, went back twice couldn't make a deal. They the next day and today trying to make a deal, they asked what they could do to make it happen. We agreed on 21500 out the door, so I went to sign the paperwork and when I got there I discovered that 21.5 did not include the $1800 plus interest. When it was pointed out the manager Don got involved and began to treat me like I was stupid and insinuated that only I was not trying to pay interest but that I had wasted his time and his employees in the service departments time because they had to wash the car. He said he wasted money to pay them. He was extremely rude and I know I will never do business with them again and would not recommend going there. I have never been more pissed at a car dealership and I feel like I was lied to and treated like crap.	0
Very good food, fair prices and portions.  Will definitely be back.  On the down side, they never provide enough rice on to-go orders.	1
The Bellagio was sadly a bit disappointing. I was in town for a trade show event in July and found the hotel overcrowded and nearly impossible to navigate during the day. A "quick" bite to eat took nearly 1.5 hours at a 2 p.m. lunch. Service was slow and lacking all over the resort.When I checked into my room, there was a massive clump of hair in the bathroom sink. Disgusting. I've staying in all kinds of hotels all over the world from two to five stars and have to say I've never seen a dirtier bathroom.We had an unfortunate incident where a colleague had to have emergency surgery while on our trip. A horrible incident anywhere, but especially when one has to spend hours in a Las Vegas ER. When I called the hotel desk in the morning to ask for a late checkout so we could visit our friend in the hospital and get her returned to her hotel. We needed to make sure she was comfortable and all arrangement were made for her family to arrive before we caught a flight out of the city that afternoon. I was informed that it would only be possible if we paid a 1/2 day rate of $70+ dollars. How unfortunate that a hotel of this supposed caliber can't accommodate a guest in their city with this type of request. Especially since our flight schedules meant that we would be on our way to the airport by 3 p.m. at the latest. The casino staff was lovely and the hotel was ok but certainly not deserving of a AAA five diamond. When I return to Vegas, I think I'll be staying at the Wynn. Sorry, Bellagio, I had higher hopes.	0
I was in today and was cut by the callous removal tool on my ankle during a pedicure. It bled and stung and was not pretty. I was compensated by a 10% discount.(?) This is not how I would do business if I wanted to retain a brand new customer whom I just cut a chunk of skin off their ankle. Ouch! good thing i didnt have an event tonight and had to wear heels. Horrible service!	0
Great for quick mexican food. Great prices as well. Do yourself a favor and call ahead to make your order and it will be ready within 10 minutes! The chicken nachos are a dream if you're into that sorta thing.	1
Scones are outrageously good. So is the SCC. They have recently been experimenting with not calling your nameout, which is a nice change, makes it quieter.	1
I am not sure why other people gave this restaurant more that 2 stars. I had a terrible dinner. The appetizer called a Charcuterie plate was dry, bland toast triangles, squares  of cheese like we used to have in high school, some dried cranberries and almonds. Their Twisted Burger, which was supposed to be their specialities, had so much overly sweet onion jam, barely cooked bacon, unmelted cheese and tons of mayo that it was inedible.. The fries were cold. And the most surprising part was the wine pour, barely 3 oz. in a big wine glass. The owner was running the bar. and the waitress told us that's all  he allowed.  The wine was really good, and was from their own winery. You would think they would give at least a normal pour as bottles are available for purchase. Talk about poor marketing!  After commenting to the waitress, the second glass had a little more. I asked to taste a wine and was told the bottle wasn't open and i would have to order a glass. Wouldn't it have made more sense to open the bottle, as I may have purchased it or at least had 1-2 glasses. Poor marketing again.This was the second time I tried this restaurant, knowing it was bad the first. But wanted to give them another chance as they were new the first time.  I would have thought they would cater more to their patrons, as this time of the year, most of us in AZ are residents and it could become one of our favorites.  I hate to see restaurants destroy themselves when a new chef and some better customer service, along with a customer-friendly owner could surely help.* By the way, the food pictures below were not even on the menu.	0
Schnitzel Wiener Art: Classic breaded pork cutlet, served with cranberries and homemade Bavarian style potato salad.Jumbo complete: giant pretzel served with 'Obatzer' Cheese, sweet mustard and onion mustardOktoberfest Braten Teller: Bavarian pork and beef specialty with pork roast 'hunter style' and Spatzle, marinated pot roast (sauerbraten) with vegetables and red cabbage.	1
AC didn't work in our room and room smelled like sewage. Pool was good, steak restaurant was good. Won't stay there again.	0
This place has some of the best BBQ I ever had in my life and the stuff is super friendly and funny	1
The Carne Asada tacos are awesome ! I plan to be back to check out more menu items. I love the fact the Hobe meats counter is located inside the restaurant . I will need to pick up some to go items the next time I have time to cook .	1
I have never in my life dealt with such arrogant employees at any type of establishment. I've heard stories from friends and acquaintances about rude or lack of service and on one occasion I witnessed bartenders giving patrons attitude, but always giving the benefit of the doubt I thought maybe it was a bad night or whatever. Recently a few of my friends and i went for a couple of brews after work, it was around 1am. At 1:45 we ordered a round for last call but were informed that they already had last call. Thats odd, we were seated at the bar and none of us have a hearing impairment and it wasnt noisy. When my friend mentioned that no one heard it we were verbally assaulted (i wont go into detail, it was a rather lengthy exchange and recounting that night is making my blood boil) by the lovely female bartender. She also informed us that they are closing early because "we close when we want. If you don't like it leave and dont come back" we were told. And then one of the awesome male bartenders finely spoke up only to call one of his paying customers a prick because he said "fine. We wont."Yes, this is how they treat they're consumers. I dont care how many beers you boast, no establishment in the service industry has a right to treat their customers in this manner. Im ashamed to be the dutchess and i wont step foot in this place again. They've made it abundantly clear they dont care about returning customers.	0
This place is a cluster f$@k and Dale Jr should be ashamed. Staff had no clue of what they had, there's no drink menu and no one working could actually tell you what they even had in the place. Ridiculous!	0
The food! That is why I go there - FFFFood. They offer excellently crafted master pieces for a small price and this to me is their greatest attraction.It is French (ish) and the savoir faire is certainly there. The staff is knowledgable and very friendly. They go out of the way to ensure you are comfertable. I was also pleasantly surprised they had a \u00a328 Champagne on the list - which was soon on our table - avec our stewed beef and roasted quail, French Fries and mayonaisse.If you want the starter as a maincourse you can always ask for a bigger portion FYI.It was a bit busy but not uncomfertably so for both guests and staff, though they were on the edge but not loosing control. Highly recommended, but DO book a table if you are more than 2 people though when in the weekend.	1
Guy was right.  The 'boli's are awesome.  We got a large veggie and a meatball and that was enough for the 4 of us (granted, one is a 14 year old girl...).  The beer was extra cold and went down really smooth after the 4 hour flight into the 105 degree afternoon.  The place is truly a dive, but worth the trip off to the north side.  If you're on the south half of the strip it might not be worth the cab fare, but if you have a rental like us it is worth the drive.	1
I would not come here again for anything. Everything is over priced... Really this is Just a Showroom for Amazon.	0
I waited 31/2 hours for my tires to be changed. I was tild it would take half that time. No one came to tell me it would be longer or why. When I mentioned how long it had been they didnt acknowledge it was an inconvenience.  The waiting room was not busy so I dont know why they dint communicate wih me.	0
Some colleagues and I had supper tonight at Accords last night.  It was really nice inside.I debated about whether to order the Smoked Paprika Guinea Breast or the Beef Shoulder.  Our server suggested the beef so that's what a lot of us got.  I swapped the beets for potato.  We all found the beef chewy, kind of tough and tasteless ... a couple didn't eat theirs and sent them back.  I ate a bit of mine and passed the rest around for others to try.  When we commented about it to the manager, she tried some and said that she found it was tender like butter (!!??).  My colleague next to me had the guinea breast and I tried a bit ... it was delicious!  I should have gone with my first instinct.When we got back to our hotel afterwards, we had a drink in the bar and ordered snacks.	0
Great store with a lot of cool clothes!  It is true with all the other reviews...the regular price clothing can be a lil steep but you have to check out the sales rack.  I got a pair of J Brand Jeans that were originally $225 for only $68!!!  I seriously should have considered buying two pairs!  The customer service is really great and everyone is very helpful and finding your size and recommending items.  If you're in the mall, be sure to just stop in and check out the sales section...definitely worth your time!	1
We came to ride the gondolas, 4 of us. We were interested in riding the outside ones, so we asked an employee who was there greeting us as we walked in where we could purchase them. He directed us to a desk with 2 guys, who said they could sell them to us. Come to find out he was just trying to sell us show tickets and wasted an hour of our time. Once he realized we weren't  buying any show tickets, he told us where we could buy them. He also told us my daughter  was too young to ride, she is 2.5. Once we got outside, they said she could and we couldve bought the tickets out there in the 1st place. So we get on and the ride was nice, too short though. Same price as 1 of the pictures they try to sell you at the end. Then as we were about dock, our boatman mentions that tips are greatly appreciated.  I was going to tip, but felt kind of odd being asked to tip. I still did, but felt weird afterwards. Never again. Plus too, there is no buffet here, and if there is I couldnt find it. Felt like I was at a car lot and just got suckered. Employees here just felt too pushy, like those people in the mall. And they didn't have their information right. Nice hotel, but the customer service is terrible!	0
Stay away from this train wreck of a hospital , ER is very unprofessional and I can't believe they can treat people that way. Doctors don't have any idea what they are doing, but they will take your money and if you don't like the way you where treated, to bad and good luck filing a complaint or talking to any one, they are the cricket of hospitals and if you have ever had cricket and had any problems you will be familiar with the way they do things at st lukes.  NEVER AGAIN ILL DIE FIRST BEFORE DEAL WITH THOSE LOOSERS!!!	0
Seriously?  Who likes this chain bs quality crap?I like myself a badass sandwich.  This place DOES NOT have it.Inadequate portions, inadequate food, un-personable service and tacky typical "bread/bakery co" atmosphere.  I've now been over 5 times since i moved here 4 months ago, and not one visit has been satisfactory or fulfilling.  I'm going to wildflower with better portions and flavor or taking a trip to pane bianco.  Dont waste your taste buds.	0
J2 Cleaning did an outstanding job of cleaning my carpet and floor tile. Charles was absolutely wonderful! Jesse came out to give me a quote and Jeff set up my appointment. Everyone was so pleasant and professional. Mike also stopped by to help stretch my carpet in two rooms. I had several cracked tile and knew they probably would crack again if replaced. Charles used a filler and they look 100% better.  I will never use another company for my carpet and tile cleaning needs, trust me they are the best! I should also mention their rates are more then fair.Maryellen Amaro	1
Great fast Chinese food like you would find in NYC - try it. Cheap & fresh, love this place.	1
Great value for the money at approx $300/night for a large suite.  I've stayed twice and both times scored a room on the 33rd floor overlooking the Wynn golf course.I've stayed at the Venetian, TheHotel, Hard Rock, new tower at Caesars, and many others and being at a brand new hotel actually worth the money was a nice change.  While i love TheHotel, the prices are getting out of control, and i feel that the Palazzo room can compete.There are 3 TVs in the room, a small flat screen in the bathroom, and two in the suite, the first facing the sleeping area and the second in the lower lounge area.  The sitting area is the most impressive with a large L-shaped couch with enough space to seat at least 6 and a nicely sized dining table with 4 chairs.  In the corner is a small desk and chair.The hotel itself has great restaurants and is attached to the Venetian for even more variety.  The Palazzo shops continue to expand upon the introduction of the first and only Barney's in Las Vegas. The only downside to this property is that I couldn't determine if it had it's own pool.  We walked to the Venetian pool, which was quite a trek through the maze of the Canyon Ranch Spa.I'm staying again in September and for any other last minute trips, i'll be sure to try this first.  I sure hope the rates don't get jacked!	1
The service was fine and the food was ok. But in a city known for food and service, ok doesn't cut it. We had to run an errand in the area and decided to grab dinner while we were there. I think we would have been better off saving the money and going back home. There was nothing remarkable about the food. I ate some mediocre dishes that seemed to largely come from frozen. Nothing was horrible, but we will not be going back.  On a friday night, there was no prime rib, no seafood, nothing at all special.  And at $17 per person, I really wish I would have taken a few moments to read reviews before we'd gone in.  I could have had a much better dinner for the same dollar hundreds of other places in the city, literally.  And in the future, I will be doing so.	0
Definitely one of the better shows I been to.  I've personally never watched a live Madonna, Elvis, Rod Stewart, Donna Summer or MJ concert but these impersonator were pretty damn good. I was feeling the energy as if I was watching the real thing. The MJ performer was sick so he wasn't there boo. But the show must go one right.They killed it, the band, backup singers, and dancers also killed it.  There was never a dull moment. I wanted to just jump up and boogie. They have lots of seats and they were packed. There was also Large screens which played videos of the original singers while the impersonator performed.	1
Waited 50 minutes today for a pulled pork and a hot link sandwich before asking for our money back. I can't imagine how much longer we would of had to wait. I've heard nothing but good things about this place.so disappointed. They weren't even busy!!	0
Before I jump into this review, let me just preface it by saying that I'm really not a fan of chain restaurants (Chipotle, Jersey Mike's and Yogurtland excluded). And in my opinion, the Cheesecake Factory embodies everything I hate about chain restaurants. Right off the bat, our server was rude and disinterested. And every time he visited the table next to us, he stood between their table and ours, with his behind right in our faces. He was incredibly slow in delivering drinks (we only ordered iced tea) and only came by to refill once. I ordered the Evelyn's Favorite pasta which was surprisingly one of the few vegetarian items on the menu (aside from salads). My only request was to take off the Kalamata olives. Of course, when the food was delivered, it was chock-full of olives. So not only did the pasta lack flavor to start with, but the small amount of flavor that I was able to detect was ruined by the olives. I'm not a complainer, and I hate sending food back, so I picked as many out as I could, but it wasn't really worth salvaging. I mostly just pushed the pasta around my plate, took a few bites, and pushed it aside, which is disappointing since it's a $13 bowl of pasta. When the bill finally arrived, it added up to just under $50 for two iced teas, one bowl of pasta and one cobb salad. I'm sorry, but that price is just absolutely exorbitant for the poor service and lack luster food. This visit was most definitely my last visit to the Cheesecake Factory. And if you happen to be looking for dinner at the Biltmore, I would suggest you stop ANYWHERE else.	0
Had dinner with my wife on 9/4/2013.  Service and food were top-notch, we were seated within 10 minutes even though it was crowded around 7:30.  We had two appetizers and the small Round New York Cheese pizza.  My wife had the Eggplant Pizzettes, 3 breaded discs with ricotta and a very tasty marinara sauce.  I had the Tomato & Burrata, which is their version of Caprese salad.  Instead of sliced tomatoes, sliced mozzarella, and basil, this had a circle of quartered small tomatoes around a big ball of fresh mozzarella.  The plate was also seasoned with olive oil and basalmic.  The mozzarella was absolutely the freshest I've ever had, but our server told us that it was not made in the restaurant.  The pizza was excellent, great cheese, great sauce, great crust.  Next time we're back in Las Vegas, I want to try the Baked Ziti and Brooklyn Chicken.	1
This is the second time I've hit Churchhill's and it was a disappointment. The fish was warm at best, limp with the batter separating from the fish. I've been to the UK, and this is nothing like that.The fries were ok, coleslaw was bland, and they really did not know how to pour a Guinness pint. I would not recommend this to any serious English food fan. (And there is good food in the uk!)	0
Intense variety, most everything is quite tasty. Well worth it.	1
I did my research on yelp on vegas buffets prior to arrival.  Since I stayed at the MGM, I thought I'd give The Buffet at Bellagio a try.  i went on a tuesday, no wait.  went in at 3pm for the lunch price like what the other yelpers suggested to do, and ate lunch and dinner food.  The only difference between lunch and dinner was that they offered sashimi and instead of flank steak, they had prime ribs.  Big whoop.  Most of the yelpers said it's one of the best buffets in Vegas.  After I started eating for a while, I wondered if I actually went into the right hotel.  To think that Bellagio is one of the bigger and nicer hotels and yet they fail to even make sushi, wow that sucks.  Their super generic sushi is even worse than ones at Safeway.  Heck, even my friends can make better sushi than that!! The flank steak was chewy as heck.  the leg of lamb tasted more like duck.  I only went to this buffet a few days ago, and I can't even remember what I ate because nothing stood out!!! I guess i have to try all the other shitty buffets in vegas before I'll appreciate the wonders of the buffet at bellagio.  until then it's still 2 stars in my book.	0
friend suggest this place for lunch. the location is a bit of a pain in the ass to park at. friend was already there and most of the tables were taken. i ordered the pad thai and he had the chicken over rice.didnt get any utensils when the food came. had to ask for utensils since there was none placed on the table.best pad thai ive had in town and the portions were pretty big. i was stuffed after eating it.friend suggested the pork over rice next time. sorry i dont remember the name.	1
I just returned from Vegas for a holiday girls' trip, and the Spa at MOLAS was one of our stops during our vacation.  My travel partner works concierge at the spa at Mandarin Oriental's DC location, so she was interested and checking out the facility even though neither of us could spare the cash to splurge on a treatment here.  This review is strictly for the facilities, which I simultaneously found both incredibly impressive and disappointing.  Disappointing only because the spa lacks some of my favorite standard spa amenities like a jacuzzi (they only had a warm "vitality pool" which was at least 10 degrees cooler than how I would run my bath) and a sauna.  To me, use of the spa facilities are half the draw of visiting a spa even when I do book treatments so the lack of some of my favorite amenities was a bit of a bummer.  That aside, this spa has a lot going for it.  The spa areas were immaculately clean, attractively modern in their design, offered stellar views of the strip, and had a lot of cool techy features like experience showers with touch screen menus and the ability to turn on the jets for the vitality pool on a station/lounger by station/lounger basis rather than for the whole pool.  Their relation room is one of the nicest and most relaxing one I've ever been in, with plenty of beds situated in front of windows overlooking the strip to rest in while waiting for your appointment or just to get some rest.  Finally, I can't say enough good things about their staff.  The service was top notch, friendly and extremely attentive without being obtrusive.  Always there to offer you a towel, a bottle of water or to fetch eye makeup remover for when the experience showers have ruined your eyeliner and you've neglected to bring your own.  Really top notch service.	1
5 stars for a simple market and deli with some killer good freshly prepared food.I've been coming here for years.  I find the portions to be reasonable, and the quality of the food top notch.  Go to the counter, place  your order, and they'll call you up to do a pick up when it's ready.Nothing like going in for a quick lunch and walking out with a bunch of grocery items, a chunk of feta, a pound of tabbouleh, and a bag of freshly baked pita breads.I'm a fan of their food overall.  There are excellent options for vegetarians.  They also make outstanding stuffed grape leaves.  True story- during one of my pregnancies I craved these, and went twice a week to get them.  They are as good now as they were then.There is seating here, so you can go with a small group and have lunch easily.Don't forget to pick up some freshly prepared baklava for dessert!	1
It's a really groovy space. I had an excellent burger. Our server Gerardo was terrific. We spoke with the manager Suda who was also lovely. If you're looking for a super groovy new school Mexican restaurant downtown, definitely check out La Comida.	1
If you're looking for a lot of food for the money this place is great as the portions are huge.  But unless you like the fried frozen variety of seafood you won't be satisfied.  The non-fried stuff I've ordered has been pretty blah.  Parking is a nightmare during prime times, as are the wait-times for a table, so go in off-hours for sure.	0
For excellent local food I suggest Po'Boys. Their pizza is great (if you are a fan of deep dish, then this is not the place for you). I would say their smoked chicken, polish sausage and rib tips are great!Parking is easy and they have beer, wine and spirits.	1
I saw the mixed reviews, and thought, let's give it a chance.  It's close, it has delivery, and I might get lucky.  Even after placing the order with the lady who didn't speak a lick of English (and had to call back to repeat our credit card number six times), I thought "Hey, she can't speak English, it must be authentic!"  Well, that logic fell short.The sushi rolls were by far the worst I've had in a while.  I'm not being a snob.  I've been satisfied with sushi from supermarkets -- but this place just doesn't cut it, especially for the prices.  As for the other items: salad dressing, bleh.  Miso soup, alright. Tempura, bland.On the positive side, I've heard that poor quality sushi means lower mercury content!  So here's to my health.	0
My husband and I heard many good things about this place so off we go. We get seated they take the order. Good so far. Menu looks good. Then I hear two waitresses arguing about our order. We order the croque Madame and a bltc and a French onion soup. About 20 minutes later a different waitress comes over and retakes the order. Still we r not that concerned. 40 minutes later (1 hour since we ordered) we get the the croque madam and then they set our other sandwich and soup down at the table next to us.  Oh sorry this is theirs and move it to our table.  They then apology for the delay and off they go. Prior to this the delay has not been mentioned although the two waitresses have been to our table multiple times. (never on their own only on our request). My husband takes a bite of the chicken blt and it is raw!  RAW chicken!  We have to call a server over (not the two waitresses a man) show him it is raw he agrees, we explain that we have also waited an hour.  They then proceed to justify the RAW chicken by explaining that they have someone training. He then takes it away. I don't know about u but we don't want a new one. We are a little turned off at this point. the rest of the meal is mediocre not great just ok. The bill comes and they have removed the chicken sandwich but are still justifying the RAW chicken and the delay. I ask for the manager. We felt that if they wanted to ensure our return we should not have paid for anything. The manager comes over and it is the man that took the sandwich away. He proceeded to once again justify the delay and raw chicken. I told him that a free sandwich we did not eat because it was raw was not the appropriate way to take care of a customer. Until the check came we were more than polite. The waitress was now at the table as well. She says "do u want the meal for free". I respond "it is not about the money I will pay however you should have offered it for free". She got upset grabbed the check and said " fine don't pay". It wasn't that we did not want to pay but our experience here was horrific. If it was my business I would have waived the entire bill and gave a gift certificate to come back. Taking the RAW chicken off the bill is just not good enough. We put $20 on the table and left. We will never go here again and tell everyone we know this story. A zero rating is more appropriate.	0
What a find on the SE corner of Washington and Buffalo.  We live in the neighborhood and are always trying to find great restaurants off strip.  This Italian can beat most of the big names downtown.  Chef Marc comes over to the table to describe his specials.  He had been to the farmers market the day we went so lots of local fresh produce on the menu.  Fresh pastas are light and wonderful and he is accommodating if you want to order off menu.  My daughter wanted pasta with red sauce and shrimp and he gladly brought a beautiful dish that was full of flavor.  My husband had the fresh caught halibut that was so fresh it was not on the menu.  I had the thin breaded veal with a salad on top with aged balsamic vinegar.  Other specials sounded great and next time I will be sure to bring a large crowd to share.   Service was excellent. A good bottle of wine was recommended as well.  The rum cake was great - not too sweet.  This Italian restaurant is on top of our favorites list and we will be going back over and over again.	1
For a city that embodies glitz and glamor, you would think the airport would be a little bit nicer.  Out of all the places I have flown in and out of, I think the Vegas airport is one of my least favorite airports.  Dismal food choices, cramped conditions, and an abundance of slot machines makes this place a horrible spot to be stuck in.  Looking out the windows during my layover to CA, I remembered the food I had on my last trip.  Wonderful, over the top and memorable, my mouth began to water.  Here I looked around the airport and what did I end up settling for.Sabarro.  Ick.  The charging stations were packed so I had to find a outlet on the wall and sit on the floor and the inside of the airport is just a poor reflection of what Las Vegas is.  When you fly into Nashville, you get the feeling of Country Music or even Providence you are greeted with ocean feelings.  You get nothing at the Vegas airport.The only thing that I do like about this airport is maybe Ethels.if I want chocolate and that Southwest has a hub here.	0
The food at Timbers is ok but their service is lacking.  This is nearby my work so I have been here a few times and the service got worse each time.  It is a waste of money to be a patron here.	0
i was in tilted kilt with my daughter,  her friend joined us to watch a soccer game we were eating our lunch when a manager asked us to leave because a server not our server didnt like my daughters friend...seriously we were a paying customer i will never give my business to that tilted kilt or any other i put a call into corporate with no response so i guess they dont care if they have customers. NEVER AGAIN SAVE YOUR MONEY THE FOOD IS HORRIBLE!!!	0
This dry cleaner recently took over from the previous owners that I decided to stop going to because they didn't accommodate alterations on site. My daughter wanted a neighborhood cleaner to bring her Sanctuary Elements uniform to...a Diane Von Furstenberg dress that she has to have cleaned weekly. She asked me to drop off her dress so I decided to add a White House/Black Market cotton/viscose sweater to be cleaned. White House is my go-to store for all my work clothes.When I went to pick up the dress and sweater, my sweater was BEIGE!!! The young girl behind the counter saw my face and said "Is their something wrong?" I said "Yes, my white sweater looks like its been ruined. It was white." She said "I'm sorry, we've had trouble with the guy in the back.  I will put it back through to be cleaned again."  I relented.A week later I went to pick it up. Now, let me tell you. A cotton and viscose sweater has a shiny thread appearance to it. It is has a lusterous rather than matte fabric.  My sweater looked beat-up, dingy, grayed, frayed and lacked the original luster it held. Obviously, the cleaners damaged it the first time and in order to get the discoloration or polluted smog out of it they had to bleach it. The sweater recommends you use non-chlorine bleach. It has the option to hand wash or dry clean. The owner Martin happened to be the one I was greeted by upon pick up. I very calmly spoke to him and told him I was not happy. I said, "My sweater is ruined. It's lost its white color and is quite frayed. It's not shiny anymore." He said, "I am sorry and paused." I said, "I would like it replaced." He said, "You will have to find your receipt. Bring a copy of your receipt and I will reimburse you." I agreed and he asked to retain the sweater.This sweater wasn't horribly expensive. It was $88 but i got it on sale for $66.88. I keep all my receipts and found it. I returned one week later and left off a copy of the receipt with a new clerk.  I was told I would get a call when my check was ready to be picked up.I didn't get a call back. This was a busy time for me so i finally got over there on Christmas Eve to pick up my reimbursement check. Martin was there. He said "I am not going to reimburse you. I took your sweater to the White House/Black Market store and spoke to two sales people and the manager. I compared your sweater to another similar sweater and everyone agreed it was just like new." I was flabbergasted.  I said, "You're kidding right? You went to the store?  I'm embarrassed for you. You can't tell it has been ruined? Your clerk said that you had trouble with another work who turned it beige."  He said something like ... the sweater was cleaned properly and I have been reassured by the store it is in its original condition.  I don't remember what he said after that.  I can't believe a store would not stand by its customer's disapproval of their services and not make amends.  You guys!  My sweater is un-wearable! It's off to Goodwill. I am not the kind of person to get mad at vendors. I don't complain and if you ask anyone I am usually overly agreeable and provoke a group consensus. I also am going to write customer service at White House. I find them to be a reputable company that stands behind their products. I think Martin wanted to be right instead of satisfying a customer. All over $66.88. Ridiculous!  I would not recommend this company. My daughter has told the Sanctuary to not use this dry cleaner either for their uniforms. They have two locations. Please don't go to either one of them. at 3375 E. Shea Blvd. or 9301 E. Shea Blvd.	0
Talk about some real vietnamese food being delivered right to your door step ( 3 mile radius, I am 7 miles away almost got turned down but talked him out of it, yessir!) Thanks to the pictures of food and the menus on yelp which helped out awhole lot. The phone order was easy and smooth. It took about an hour due to 2 deliveries before mine but well worth the wait. We ordered the crispy fried spring rolls, Pho Tai Bo Vien, Combo vermincelli, vietnamese sausage and marinated slice pork vermincelli, and kalbi ribs with rice. The food was very fresh and really flavorful, everything was really tasty especially the broth of my pho, the kalbi ribs was the best, tender and packed with flavor.My family and I loved every bite. We will be ordering more to come.	1
Worst McDonalds experience ever. Rude ignorant jerk behind the counter, the General Manager standing right next to him, GM said nothing, did nothing about the rotten employee. No greeting, just a dead rude stare, I asked for a meal, he said in a low negative antagonistic tone, "What about it?!?", like he was picking a fight.I realize minimum wage gets minimum effort employees, but wow McDonalds!!!!I will never go to this location EVER again.Oh yeah, twice previously got tea that tasted like chemicals, like it was dish water, seriously and on 2 different occasions.	0
I usually go to la Canasta Capitolio but yesterday my friend suggest we should try the other Canasta on 7th Ave. Bad idea, we got there first time ok, we did not know if you order at front it was only to go, if you want to eat there you have to seat. We order at the front and walk to the dinning area and then the manager comes all agited and mad at us because we order to go not to dine in if we really wanted to dine in we will have to pay him $3.00 at the moment, after all that we finally got our food Green Chili Chimichangas. Food taste ok but when we were almost done my friend found a RUBERBAND on her food.YUCK that was the end of it. We had to talk to the Manager again. Honestly if you can avoid that place better.	0
Went to the store to order a deep dish pizza with pepperoni/sausage on one side and ham/pineapple on the other side. The guy kept getting the order wrong and I had to correct him two times and finally someone came over to help. When I got home I found that they sliced the pizza into 16 slices with each one being less than 2 inches wide. Pizza tasted good but I will not be using this location again.	0
I haven't even lived there and I'm writing a review because of how horrible my phone call was just now. I talked to a leasing agent who basically did not listen to a word I said. I was very clear in my needs and what I wanted (1 bed, no pets, etc etc), and she sounded like she was reading a script the entire time. Telling me about the amenities and the wonderful parking and blah blah blah, I finally had to ask her just to give me the prices. I said I wanted a short term lease, under a specific budget, and needed to move in by a specific date. Continuing with reading off a sheet of paper she starts listing all the 1 bedrooms they have that are out of my price range, exceeding the date I need, and not even considering the short term lease I asked for. When I finally said "It sounds like there's nothing there that fits what I need, thank you" she hung up on me! If this is how they treat prospective tenants... yikes.	0
Went to a soft opening of Meat and Three, the hot new restaurant that is set to officially open in a few days. This place is the brainchild of Bread & Butter's, culinary genius Chef Chris Herrin. It is located just a hop skip and jump away from the bakery.The focus on this place is serving homestyle dinners which consists of your choice of meat and 3 sides, hence Meat and Three!! Comfort food Southern style! You place your order and pay at the counter, seat yourself, server brings out your food.The Food - Menu above the wall divides the list into four sections: variety of meats, then your choice of 3 sides:  cold or hot sides and pudding cup flavors. If your carb conscious like me you'll love that you are not just limited to potatoes either. You can choose any 3 sides you want.I chose to have the glazed root veggies, fresh fruit and chocolate/nutella pudding cup and Beef Brisket my meat choice. My side orders were served in colorful ramekins.  The Beef Brisket was served on a separate plate and was a pretty generous portion enough to feed 2! The savory juices made it fork tender. Combined with the root veggies, it was a perfect hearty meal. The puddin cup was the perfect size, rich and creamy chocolate.  I thoroughly enjoyed every bite of my meal. It is a good value for what I paid. I'm just concerned for families w/younger children. It can get steep paying the set price.  Would be cool if they had a more affordable price structure set for families on certain days. Like a Sunday Family dinner nite (hint hint) Service - Friendly and my order came out pretty quickly.  Atmosphere - Casual, country chic interior, the DIY wall art gives it a special kind of charm, table seating consists of separate tables & chairs for 2 or 4, banquette bench seating along the wall, communal/cafeteria style picnic table in center of dining area for larger parties, or the more sociable bunch. Seating out in front of restaurant if you want to dine Al Fresco. Looking forward to the official launch and many more meals here!	1
One star minus one star = zero stars!! Please let me help you if you are thinking about eating here: DONT! I am an avid connesieur of buffets and this place is a hot mess!! I was put off immediately by the uncleanliness but we proceeded, watered down crab, amnesia salad made with mayonnaise, mushy food all around...don't eat here ever, waste of money! They have a sign that says they wool	0
I went here with my husband last night (a Wednesday). I first want to mention that we are both vegetarians, so I won't be the best person to listen to regarding entrees. I had a restaurant.com certificate and since my husband loves blues music I thought it would be fun to go order some drinks and appetizers and listen to the live band. In order to even get into the restaurant, we had to pay a $5 pp cover charge. (I don't remember ever paying a cover charge to go eat at House of Blues while they had live music...have things changed?) Well, we said, we had already made a special trip to get there. We paid $10 and sat down. Our server was very nice and helpful, but after "love" let out the place filled up and service came to a standstill. We ordered the fried pickles, nachos, mac n cheese, and strawberry shortcake. The pickles were so salty I couldn't eat them (unless I wanted to head straight to the doctor for blood pressure medicine), the mac n cheese was eh, and the cake in the strawberry shortcake was soggy. The nachos were good but they didn't have BBQ sauce on them like the menu stated, and we were for some reason charged an extra dollar for cheese. Extra for cheese on nachos? Service was at a halt by the time we got our check so we didn't feel like arguing over the extra dollar... I guess I can't complain much. In all, I would say that if you are looking for a lounge experience to drink and listen to music- this place is great. Draft beer is $10 for the first glass and $2 for refills, a good deal if you don't have to drive home like we did. The band was pretty good too. If you are going to eat dinner, be prepared for some "ok" food and not being able to hear the people at your table over the live music.	0
IF YOU DONT HAVE A SENSE OF HUMOR- dont go.this place is hilairious!! Everyone there is having a blast, and everyone is always laughing... staff is really funny and there is a great ENERGY.. if you get offended easy,  you will not like this place.  Staff will make you a paper hat, and make you wear something that says something really funny, possibly degrading..etc etc.The live band is AWESOME.. they play all songs by request.  (steve miller band, eagles, sublime, etc etc..). .. great place to go to- to just kick back, have some drinks and chill out!	1
I wholeheartedly agree with Mike K. - for your money, this is a great deal in Charlotte. The Dowd Y is a very nice gym that offers a bevy of group fitness classes, up to date (and always functioning) equipment and a super clean atmosphere. Why I love this Y in particular...the machines are always in service (and I've head that techs are out fixing them weekly if need be). They also do not allow any children under the age of 16 in the workout areas. Now, don't get me wrong, I love kids, just not when I'm trying to get my sweat on. As mentioned before, this Y offers so many great group classes. I'm a big fan of Total Strength, Pilates Mat and Kickboxing. I've also heard the Spin classes are great. I've tried Athletic Conditioning, and while it certainly is an awesome workout, make sure you're at least in decent shape before you partake in that class! It's a rough one. As other reviewers have noted, this gym can get packed especially after 5 pm during the weekdays. So be patient while parking. Some classes can get a bit crowded too, so keep that in mind when you're sprawling out your mat or equipment. I haven't had any issues with theft in the locker room, but I'm a big proponent of a big papa lock on my locker. For the money and the friendly service, the Dowd YMCA is a great deal for anyone looking to slim down or tone up.	1
Charles did a great job installing the new door - and fast!  Avondale's prices were reasonable too. Thanks.	1
so yes, i'm a sucker for discount hair cuts, despite my previous bad luck. i did have a great haircut that cost 30 bucks, but at the rate i'm losing it, i'm willing to forego the price for a quick in/out discount cut. today i opted for great clips, just a few blocks from the house. you can schedule online, which alot of folks did, but luckily, there were many stylists working today, so i had to wait maybe 5 minutes. the cut came out exactly like i asked for...and she even blended my pesky cowlick on the crown of my head, something many, many, many stylists neglect to do. but what i really appreciated was my stylists comments about my thinning hair. she didn't ask, she just said i should look into some products to help alleviate my impending baldness. it's not chrome dome yet, but it's slowly running away from my forehead. i do appreciate when someone else can let me know when i can benefit from some extra help. so i start today with "hair retention" product. we'll see..overall, a nice, quick cut. i hope it's consistent...then it'll be 5 stars!	1
I am not sure about the dining in experience at Brothers. We have always had their pizza delivered to our office. Roughly ten people and everyone always loves their pizza. Caveman, Super Mario etc all have been great.	1
Haha I'm not sure why I haven't reviewed this place. But I've had many a drunken night here. So Carnival Court is an outdoor bar in between Harrah's and Imperial Palace. This bar is Harrah's Money Maker. It's usually packed and the bartenders are all flairdevils(Flair Bartending group)They have a band area.dj.sometimes 80s bands, cover bands.etc...Roomy dance area. Most of all folks, they pour heavy. OH YEA. With Flair bartenders you get a show. Don't expect to just drink and run. The crowd is friendly and drinks just flow. Try not to expect expensive drink prices. Because it averages 6 bucks versus the clubs and their 10 -11 dollar drinks. It's loud and just like going to spring break in Tijuana or Ensenada. Check out Renee Garcia who's been there since they opened. Filipino dude usually works the front of the bar facing the stage. World Champion Christian Delpeche from Argentina flairs there, etc.If you think the movie Cocktail you know what flair is...WRONG AGAIN.	1
Hands down my favorite Froyo place. My kids love, it, my wife loves it too! It's in our neighborhood and offers quality Froyo!The price is right for the quality. The staff is always friendly, and even after a few times remembers who you are. They recently expanded to have Gelato and some other things, in my personal opinion shouldn't have because the Froyo was awesome. This is the best place around, wouldn't drive anywhere else!	1
I stayed at the IP last week for a trade show I was attending at the Sands Convention Center.  I am not going to share anything here that the previous 85 reviews have not already said but maybe I can summarize.  -Friendly staff but in some cases understaffed.-Center Strip location.  Across from Cesar's, next to Harras and the Flamingo.-Monorail station attached to the hotel.-Older hotel.  Furniture and fixtures are from the early 80's-The IP does have an old, dingy appearance but from my experience it was clean.  Everything worked in my room. -Only a hand full of TV channels on the in-room TV. -Walking distance to the Sands Convention Center-Direct Monorail ride to the Las Vegas Convention Center.  -About half the cost of other hotels in the area. Let's face it.  You get what you pay for and the Imperial Palace is no exception.  I normally stay a places a bit nicer than this but on the other hand I saved $500 bucks over the five days I stayed there.  Overall It's a decent hotel in a very prime location.	0
Club is completely over crouwded, they herd you like cattle,, even if you have bottle service, which for 10 people was 4k. They dont treat you oike anytihng special,, My husbands credit card had a problem with a hold because the fruad department fladded it from him using it so much,, even after the vip host talked ont he phone with his bank, she still did not let us get even 1 bottle to start our night.. we all just sat at out over crowded 4k table desperately needing a drink, We all finally got fed up and left, the next day his card had been swiped so many times by this place even after we left from the frustration. They could not of been less accomidating. Nightmare of a place,, the music was very nice and an awesome sound syste,m though. They need to filter the amount of people in there and work on the guest relations.	0
Good restaurant gone bad! We used to go there twice a week. Now we go twice a year. Maybe. They used to have shrimp. Now they don't. Ok I can live without it. The extra bowl was $3 now it's $4. They used to keep great care to make sure that all the containers were full. Now it seems they don't care. Then they went to serve yourself drinks. And sauces. And napkins. So. What is the appropriate tip to the server? You make your own bowl. Get your own drink. Your own refill. Your own Sriracha. Extra napkins. As far as I can see, the only thing the waitstaff does is bring your bowl. Hey,  call my number and I'll walk the 15 feet and get it faster. Even if I'm in the mood I won't go cause I hate not tipping much. However, we eat out many times per week and it's not fair to Tip them even 10% for doing nothing. Very sad. We really liked it. It turned into a marginal cafeteria.	0
Firstly, they do not allow their special as a take out, so as a working woman who does not have time to sit at a restaurant for lunch, I don't get to enjoy the specials? Maybe I don't get out much but that was definitely a first. So I place an order for delivery and what arrived was not what I ordered,  despite the fact that the delivery guy checked and assured me the order was correct. I asked for a wheat bun and did not get one, they say their burgers come with lettuce, pickles, onions, tomatoes, and a sauce, my "burger" was a wet bun, a pattie and some cheese (mainly stuck to the foil and paper wrapper. Then to top it all off, the fries were stale, like leftover reheated fries and were not edible in my opinion. This was my first and will be my LAST meal at Burger Rush, what you get is definitely NOT worth what you pay for!! TERRIBLE!!	0
Great coffee, vibe, and food. TERRIBLE parking, take the light rail if you can!	1
This place is brand new, clean, and reasonably priced.	1
I walked in for the first time and had to get the cashiers attention because she was texting on her phone. My order: veggie low mein, cream cheese wontons, white rice. (Vegetarian)Received: veggie low mein, crab puffs, and pork fried rice. I asked the cook for what I originally asked for, and he said he did what the ticket said, then proceeded to show me it. I said, if I could eat this I would but I'm a vegetarian. He brought me over a bowl of steamed rice and after separating the pork out of my vegetable low mein, it tasted good. We left within 5 minutes if receiving my food because the cashier was screaming in Chinese on the phone at someone. Bad idea to go there.	0
NY'er trying to find thai in Pittsburgh came across Nicky's Thai.  Curry sauces had too much brocolli and red peppers. Curry sauce very thin and too much coconut milk.   Had the chef duck special and was very salty .  On a brighter note pad thai and thai ice tea was good.  conclusion this is not authentic thai!	0
On a recent visit to Charlotte, a friend and her husband picked  me up at CLT to take me to my hotel, and we decided to get a bite to eat before they dropped me off.  They told me about Cowfish and how good their sushi was as well as their burgers and milkshakes.Granted it was a Friday evening, and it did not seem to be overly crowded, so I was not expecitng a 90 minute wait.  But it gave my friends and I a chance to sit and catch up as we waited.	1
The food was amazing! Service was great!  The chicken Marsala was everything that I was looking for. Eating there felt like eating at your Italian grandma's house. We will be going back often.	1
This place is FUEGO !  Easily the Best burger in the City.  I've eaten almost everything on the menu but really enjoy the Euro Burger.  Truffle aioli, goat cheese and warm tomato - BOOM !  Gordon also makes up a great shake but the Chocolate Hazelnut pudding, coffee, praline cookie is mind blowing.  If your UP any money THIS IS THE PLACE TO SPEND IT.	1
I love this place!! If you are interested in a private room, just call ahead and let them know and they will tell you what time to come. Otherwise, walk-ins are always welcome and I have never had to wait a very long time at all. Remember to always tip well and in cash!!	1
I've been meaning to eat here since I read about the best sandwiches in Charlotte in CLT magazine. Their chicken Philly steak made the list. Unfortunately, the sandwich didn't make my list. At least not a good list. Not sure who assembles these lists of best sandwiches in town, but I've been driving around tasting them all and I have not been impressed by one of them. I had some of my son's French dip, and I have to agree with another yelper. Not good at all. But I will carry on looking for places in CLT I can brag about. Yelp on!	0
When I was younger, my aunt and uncle and cousins lived in Kenosha, WI.  We would drive up a few times a year to visit them, and after 2 hours of peering out the car windows along 94, my brother and cousins and I would be dying to get out of the car at any of the attractions along the way--Six Flags, the outlet malls, or any of the many cheese shops that announced your arrival to Wisconsin.  When I went skiing with friends at Cascade Mountain last winter, years of unfulfilled longing swept over me and I demanded that we stop at one.  The one we selected was the Mousehouse Cheesehaus, chosen mostly for it's cute sign and awesome name.  Being a lover of all things dairy walking in, I beelined for the cheese counter, demanding samples of anything and everything.  Oh my!  Anything from a basic, kid friendly American to a 15 year aged Cheddar, to their own special haus cheese.  I probably walked out with a good 2 lbs of various cheeses (and am still wondering how those seemed to add 10 lbs to my figure, but that's another story).  In addition, there were the usual Wisconsin knick knacks, including many types of beers, wines, and other kitsch-y stuff like ashtrays and bottle openers.  The woman working at the counter didn't seem too charmed by my friends and I, but I'm sure I would tire of travelers demanding cheese nibbles after a while, myself.	1
OK, here's the bottom line.  Carlo's bakery is a world famous name.  You are going to have to wait in line and it is going to be crazy inside the bakery, as every bakery should be.  Get over it.  This is a real New York style bakery (which I have seldom found outside of New York no matter what the sign says).  New York baked goods are less sweet than out here and the flavors are more subtle. . . the way it should be.  Everything I had was SPOT ON as far as flavor and presentation goes.  On a scale of 1-10, cheese cake was a 9.  Crumb cake was a 10.  Canaille was a 10 (was pre filled which was a little disappointing but still nice and crispy.  Brownie with nuts was an 8.  Both the carrot and red velvet cupcakes were a 10.  I am a baker and very hard to please.   I say go, wait in the line and enjoy some baked goods the way they were meant to taste.	1
Came in on a Thursday afternoon for lunch with a friend. It was buffet style where all the marinated and raw meats were in containers. Everything from pork to beef, and some squid as well. They had soup and rice on the side and also a salad bar. For 20 bucks it wasn't bad for lunch. I would like to comment on the lack of a sauce station so I had to look for the sauces and mixes. There was not one particular server/ bidder they just all worked together. All in all I would definitely recommend this place	1
I don't care what anyone else says, this is by far the most beautiful shopping street I have ever seen. Yes, so on rainy/snowy days it's a bit annoying having to put your brolley up every time you venture out of one shop and into another, but where else can you have capital city quality shopping on one side of the street, and a huge big grassy park and views of the gorgeous Edinburgh Castle on the other?Along the main street itself, you'll find all the usual big high street names like Gap, Topshop, Boots, Waterstones, The Body Shop etc and if it's a department store you're after ther's one at each at AND one in the middle (although Jenners is my favourite of the 3). The best thing about Princes Street though, is that it's designed in blocks like in America. It's on these little streets that cut across it every 50 metres or so that all the functional/boring day-to-day things like banks, newsagents and estate agents are - which means there's more room along the Princes Street itself for the good stuff.That said, there is one really, really, annoying thing about Princes Street (aside from the snow issues already mentioned): although it's lovely and beautiful with all the old Georgian and late Victorian architecture, it does mean that the shops are quite small and so most of the bigger ones have two or sometimes even three branches spread along this one street. The amount of times you'll be on autopilot and accidentally go to the wrong H&M for what you need, only to have to trudge what seems like a mile back along the road to the other branch, it's more than a bit of a pain.	1
I must say it is tough to get a 5 out of me.  This place however  does it.Starting off, the outside and inside of the burger restaurant was carefully crafted. Colors are done right.  Has a style if it's own.Ordering is straight forward.Burger  -  Drink and sides.Cost though I  just think was a bit high, but in the end so worth it.My first time here so I went basic with a little chip crunch on top.Solid Dark Chocolate Milk Shake and the mix of sweet potato fries and regular fries.I will start with he fries.  Delectable dish and I had the dijon and horseradish sauce.  Spectacular!The dark chocolate milkshake was a proverbial happy punch to the stomach that was so good, I wanted more.. Smooth and not overly chocolate.  Just the right amount.Now the burger, I do love burgers and I have to shout out that the best one I have ever had is at the El Corral in Bogata Colombia.  The beef standards there are so much different and better.  However, BBP does a stellar job of setting the Angus beef standard  there and giving us good quality beef.	1
This little strip mall Indian restaurant gets a bonus point for being so beautiful inside.  Very contemporary with traditional flair.  It gets minus one point beacuse it was hot.  Was thA/C broken or was the food's spicey nature taking advantage of me?  It was slightly unpleasant but I will get over it.  The Guru Palace get's 3 solid stars on it's very friendly helpful service and it's wonderful food.  I have only dined here twice and it was consitantly good.This time from the $8.99 buffett I tried the Palaak Paneer which is excellent. I of course had a piece of the Tandoori Chicken (thigh piece, I think.  I have a thing for meat on the bone-don't care for it.  That's  why I prefer Chicken Tikka.)  It was good but not as good as the Chicken Marsala.  Pungent and very flavorful. The rice was a differnt form today-not basmati which I prefer.  There was a new dish I did not recognize called Mushroom Matar (?).  It was delicious with bits of onion and peas in a tangy light gravy of sort.  I also enjoy the garlic naan.  No papdum was offerred this time.  I did enjoy a split of champagne which compliments the delightful spicey flavors without filling you up.I was so warm from the lack of a/c and hot spicy achaar chutney (my favorite) that I was melting like the wicked witch at my table. The service was very friendly and I don't know how anyone could call this expensive.  I thought it was downright cheap!  $3.99 for champagne plus two full plates of great food.  It is a great place to stop in for reliable food, kind staff and beutiful dining room.	1
Great place to have fun & party and get drunk... Bad place to eat!!! Food was so bland & plain.. Like some bad ass Mexican bar food!	0
This rental community does not offer its residences a recycling drop facility!	0
Great outdoor patio...but that is about it.  Went last night and the highlight of my meal was the cheese on the nacho appetizer.  I tried their signature margarita chicken dish...what a disappointment that was.had no taste and wasn't hot.	0
Sunday Funday started out fabulously thanks to this amazing restaurant!We started with an appetizer of chicken nachos... and MY GOD. The "appetizer" was a plate big enough to feed three hungry females and STILL have leftovers. I'm super picky when I order anything and all of my orders end up being a complicated mess (Can you substitute this? Can I have this on the side? I need dipping sauce.) Our waitress - I'm so bummed I can't remember her name - was the sweetest lady. She was so patient with me and brought out the food exactly how I wanted to see it. Everything was incredibly delicious, too.Then, to top it all off, apparently they were closing early for their company holiday party. We started noticing people disappearing from the restaurant and we asked the manager if they were closing, to which he replied, "yes, we closed at 2pm." It was 3:30 when we looked at the clock and I couldn't believe it! They let us sit and enjoy our meal without making us feel rushed or even mentioning their early closing time. That was stellar customer service and I would give them 10 stars for that if I could.Try this place - you will LOVE it.	1
Los Angeles Meets Montreal Epic night!  This place rocks!  Happened to walk in  was early for a dinner reservation near here.  These guys made me and my man feel like we were family and been coming to see them for years.  Drinks are great !  Service is fun and friendly , lots of fun clientele to chat it up with.  Cant wait to get back and party with ya all again .  Thank you for a wonderful time!	1
We went here, and had not only terrible food, but terrible service.  It was their "Grand Opening" week-end.  The only steak they had left was NY Strip, so that is what we ordered.  We also ordered Calamari that had a great description, but when she took the salads away, and brought our steaks, she mentioned that the calamari would be out in a minute.  I said since we have waited over 20 minutes; don't bother, it was supposed to be an appetizer.  Cut into our steaks, that were black on the outside and purple in the middle.  At this point I am beyond frustrated, and told her we would like to pay for our drinks and salad, and we will go.  She brought the bill, took $10 off and the calamari was still on the bill as well.I asked for a manager, and after 10 minutes no one came to the table.  I went to the register and asked if the gal could please allow me to just pay for the drinks and salad.  She said "I guess so."  I saw the waitress after we had finally squared away on the bill, and told her that my tip to her was to work someplace else if she wanted to make money.  Besides being slow, and seemingly uncaring, I felt that the management has a bit of growth to make this successful.  How do you run out of steaks on your grand opening, especially knowing the Rodeo and Homecoming were also this week-end???  Hasn't been a good restaurant in there since Sangini's (sp?)  was closed!!	0
Have used for about a year.  Initially was very satisfied.  The girls are all super friendly.  Office manager is obviously in over her head.  Would agree on a time, only to have them show up 3 hours early.  Scheduled an appt 2 months in advance.  Called an hour after they were to arrive to say they were on the way.  Mop around rugs, don't mop under kitchen  table.  A few times they left 30 minutes early.  Sent 3 girls for one hour, when I paid for 2 hours, office manager claimed "she did right by me" I  Have decided to no longer use this service	0
For me, Noodles & Company is a nice change of pace, with a good variety to satisfy most people in your party.  I've been here a couple of times, as well as locations in other cities.I don't disagree, Noodles  may not be the best value for a college student.  Good thing I have a job!  I appreciate the variety offered, with standard American fare (mac and cheese, meatballs) to Asian flare (Japanese noodles, pad thai).  Granted, none of the bowls will astonish you in the taste bud department, but I think it's a nicer option than your other Forbes Ave. choices, such as Chipotle, Primanti's, or Five Guys.	1
food - okay, $$ was okay, selection was wide enough, but the flavor really wasn't there.  Yes it was clean.For being JUST OKAY..I would have been 3 stars.but the "waiter" did not bring the highchair after he suggested it. He NEVER refilled any of our drinks.  And since I left no tip, I ran back in to leave a buck only to hear him complaining. Excuse me that you didn't even do your job!!  Argh!  Lazy people bother me to no end!SO! I'd say it's okay if you want an affordable and decent lunch but don't expect a "waiter" to wait on you!!	0
I get to go here about once a month for educational dinners.  I have never paid so don't ask about pricing.  I have had their filet mignon which is pretty good, calamari which is ok, scallops which aren't really my thing, sour dough bread which was fantastic, amazing stuffed mushrooms.  The vegetables are perfectly cooked and the mashed potatoes are great.  At the end we get the chocolate mousse cake that really ends the night well.  I have enjoyed every meal I have eaten there.	1
I was not impressed by La Cave at all. They had my favourite wine (Joh. Jos. Prum) which is = to a * on its own. but they only had it by the half bottle so that's loss of 1/2 *. The service was mediocre at best.  The food sounded like it was going to amazing and flavorful but most of it was very bland, the only exception being the beef carpacio which was amazing.

I needed a new ac and called One Call Plumbing. They gave me options whithin my budget. The installation was started the day after I made my choice and the work was finished the same day. It is the quietest system we ever had and we are saving 48% in power from our old system. I would recommend One Call for any home service.	1
So after 17 years of passing this place driving to Vegas we finally decided to stop for the $6.99 buffet and "GIANT SALAD BAR."  So yes, its a "throwback" casino or as I prefer to say, whoever owns it isn't putting any money into it and reaping the benefits of running a dive-casino and hotel. While I'd never stay the night here (I'd rather sleep on the side of the road in my car and take my chances), the buffet was equivalent to a nursing home and doubles as the employee cafeteria. Standard mashed potato based foods and casseroles, spaghetti, mac & Cheese, fired chicken, and gravy all bland just like at grandmas retirement village. The "GIANT SALAD BAR" right; thats counting the tuna salad mix, macaroni salad, loaded potato salad, tuna macaroni salad, you get the picture.other than that its a normal salad bar.The ice cream was good, I know, I know "What do I expect for $6.99."	0
Conveniently located close to St Catherine street and within walking distance of Crescent, this Republique is one of my favorite joints in the area. The service is always quick, bilingual and polite. Portions are plentiful, well-presented and reasonably priced. I like their beer tap selection as well, particularly the Leffe.Republique cocktails tend to err on the sweet side, which isn't my taste. But if you dig tropical and/or girly drinks, have one because they are delicious.If you have the white wine sangria you will like it, but you will contribute significantly to the Cafe Republique profits.So give it a try and be prepared to return.	1
Been coming here for the past couple months since I moved into the neighborhood. Overall food is a good deal for the price. Everything is fresh and good quality. Chicken skewers can be quite dry, so I would opt for the roasted chicken entree or the pomegranate chicken. Seems that a lot of people on here are complaining about the sauces. Every Mediterranean restaurant has their own style, so if you are expecting humus like you buy in the store, then don't. Yes, their humus is a bit less thick than what most are used to, and their satziki sauce has a lot of garlic. But everything is homemade! Try telling your mom to modify her family recipe to match a store brand. Psh!One of the staff forgot to include part of my order when I came to collect it, but they redeemed themselves by being overly apologetic and giving me a box of free cookies. Also, they have a rewards card as well. I'm a fan of any place that does this!	1
Recently rented a minivan to fit the visiting grandchildren.  The entire transaction was a breeze plus the people on the phone, at the desk and drop off woman were terrific!  I would use them again and highly recommend them to all my friends.	1
If you've never done Bikram Yoga before, this is a great place to start.  Not only are all the instructors extremely competent and inspiring, but there is a very friendly atmosphere here.  If you're in Phoenix and looking for a place to do Bikram, this is the place to go.  The room is large, well-lit, and has high ceilings with comfortable carpet and many mirrors.  There is free filtered water, and plenty of space and showers in the locker rooms.  Overall, a great place to practice yoga.  To borrow a phrase, at Bikram PV, all the women are strong, all the men are good-looking, and all the children are above average!	1
Gandhi is awesome. Please don't take my word for it, go try their fish tikka and fish pakora and I bet you you'll fall in love with it. This comes from a foodie who loves authentic fish!	1
Harris Grill was long one of my favorite spots to goto just about any night of the week.  However it's changed in recent months and I don't think I will return.On a recent Thursday night, my friend and I had possibly the worst waitress ever.  Her name was Amanda and this is my story about her as our waitress.She was not present for about 15 minutes after we were sat.  She finally appeared and asked us for our drink order. She disappeared for about 10 minutes before returning.  She served us our drinks then immediately left for another table. It was another 5 to 10 minutes before she came by again, this time taking our order for food.She return 5 minutes later with another round of drinks which we don't remember ordering, but we weren't going to complain. We never saw her the rest of the night.Other waitresses were making their rounds every 5 minutes out on the patio, but ours never appeared once.  I thought she may have died in back in the kitchen or was burned beyond recognition.  I even asked one of the other waitresses out of concern for her safety if she was okay.  She said they would check.  She returned not long after and said she was alright.  I relaxed a little, until another 15 minutes went by... it was now about 30 minutes since we had ordered and no food.We waited a bit longer, we still hadn't seen Amanda (our waitress for those paying attention).  An hour went by and we had had enough. I really couldn't believe this.  Not only did we not have our food, but we hadn't seen our waitress in an hour.  An hour.  What the hell?	0
The worst part of MGM. Will never come again. The prime rib and fish were the only thing can enjoy, the salmon made me even not sure what I was eating.	0
Food is decent but service makes this place a risk.  They often lose orders or screw up the orders.  So, calling ahead to save time often turns into waiting for them to fix or create the order you gave them 20 minutes prior. You'd think a neighborhood restaurant would care enough to get an order right.  Quality also varies greatly for order to order. Try Burrito Company instead.	0
The Omelette I had was REAL good, even the bread that came with it was good, and the potatoes, I would MOST CERTAINLY return to this place for Breakfast.Wife went with a Pumpkin Pancakes, which I stole a bite of, and I thought that was pretty good as well. Since was breakfast went with OJ (Its kinda like Root Beer hard to kill lol) I think I will be returning here, and would recommend them!	1
Ha!! So...they gave me back 20 dollars of my 270 dollars. Kevin promised to call me back at days end...of course, no phone call. So...I found the regulatory agency for rental cars. It's the Nevada DMV. I'm submitted my complaint tomorrow and encourage all of you to do so as well. This could turn into a class action law suit. If anyone would like to join me, here's the form to fill out. //www.dmvnv.com/pdfforms/ced020.pdf	0
They've upgraded some of their furniture to entertain larger parties! Even cuter than before! They're still as friendly here as they were when I first started coming! I'm happy!	1
Awesome steakhouse.  We were a group of nine guys of less than wealthy means but the waitstaff treated us with great respect and were always attentive.I started with some oysters just because I hadn't had any in a while and enjoyed them.  I had the New York strip, and it was the first time I've ever had it perfectly cooked to medium-rare, truly delicious.  I paired it with a glass of their syrah which was one of the best glasses of my limited experience.No one in our group complained and most raved.  For nine people with normal entrees, a few side dishes, and drinks all around the bill came to ~$900 but I imagine most people would spend more.Finally, the atmosphere was classy and understated, a welcome relief	1
Hard to believe this restaurant passes as authentic Italian, there is nothing on the menu that you would not find at an Olive Garden, which I have been to once, and I would say it was better food.  The appetizer selection was just deep fried things (Italian?), and the taste of dels entree was equally bad, blend, just salty, everything just salty no flavor, no fresh ingredients.  And EXPENSIVE to boot.	0
We are now addicted to rock fish. The first bite leaves your mouth swimming in a silky fish in a light soy sauce.  Ok so we ate 5 hours ago and are jonesing for more. On a more traditional tasteChow fun noodles with black beans sauce and beef. Or the salt and pepper pork chops. Wonder how they will reheat!!	1
Sooo glad we finally decided to try Kelly's food! After studying the menu for quite some time, I finally decided upon the tofu tacos and JB got the shrimp po' boy sandwich In addition to our entrees, we wanted to sample some small bites as well. We ordered the famous mac 'n cheese and hot Pittsburgh tofu bites. Tofu Tacos were delightful little cubes of tofu tossed in taco sauce and served on a hard shell with a bed of lettuce and salsa, sour cream and guac on the side. Good stuff, though not the highlight. Shrimp Po' Boy was "Okay" according to JB. The bun was superfluous as he took the top part off and ate it open-face, there was no sauce at all on the sammie, so JB had to douse on the Frank's Red Hot. To put it in his words, "the sandwich was good, but I wouldn't order it again" The sides and appetizers are what really shine at Kelly's. The french fries that accompanied the Po Boy were amongst the best I'd ever eaten - deep fried to golden delicious crispy perfection. The Hot Tofu Bites were sooooo good! Maybe a little too spicy (my nose was running) but the tofu's consistency was spot on, we both enjoyed immensely! Last but certainly not least, we had the Mac 'n Cheese which definitely lives up to the hype. The crispy charred cheese on top and the smooth, gooey, creamy cheese in the center compliment each other incredibly.. Service was great, nice beer selection (I got the Breakfast Stout - and it was amazingly smooth and clean), even the music was stellar. Can't wait to go back!	1
Like the food. Service SUCKED!! 2nd time in the place. Took my wife here after church on Sunday. Walked in. No greeter, no sign to sit yourself, no nothing. Um..ok. So...what do we do? You need to have someone at the front door at all times...Or at least a sign that says seat yourself.Sat at the table for 10 minutes. No acknowledgement. No menus. Just a Jamison candle bottle that we played with. Had to ask some random person sweeping if she had menus. Really? Another 10 minutes, what would you like for a drink? Are you our waitress? I don't know if your another sweeper or somebody else playing a joke on us. Acknowledge your table!! How difficult is that? Training of the employees has got to be number one and sadly its the food number one. Bummer.Maybe it was just a Sunday afternoon kind of thing, but our waitress could care less. First time in here? Thanks for coming back! No questions, no nothing. At least ask my wife...I really like the food but it does nothing for me when you can't get simple service right. We will not be back. We've had friends that have been there in the last two-3 months and say the same thing. Food is great. Service is horrible. It's not just me saying this. Fix some things and care a little bit more about your diners...I hope you make it to the 5 year mark. I'm willing to try again but it's got to be better on the 3rd time otherwise your a waste of time.Two starts cause the food is actually good. -2 cause of the 19 year old waitresses with their junk hanging out of their bras.	0
Almost smack dowm center of downtown phoenix, hannys a unique upscale bar/restaurant. Walking  into this place and you got this young hip vibe u cant find anywhere  in downtown  phoenix. The staff is amazing the  bar can get pack  pretty  quick but it does not hurt to get a table. The menu  is pack with  great option. As for me, the pizza i order was not only taste but lool quite unique. Have never seen a thin pizza  like this. Next time im down here ill for sure br stoping by again l.	1
Great food, drinks and service with Live music on most days! Check their online calendar to know the music bands playing , some of them need tickets but generally it would only mean a $5 cover charge after 9PM.  Nice happy hour deals,too! Nice place for spending special twosome time together or just hang out with friends/colleagues.I loved the ambiance, the superb lighting, feel of a cozy place with bar on one end and a separate section for music bands and empty space that turns into a dance floor in no time with awesome music. If you are the types to want to tap a foot or two with a drink, make sure your companion "is in the mood" to get up with you- the energy would be inviting for sure!!Guacamole, Mojitos and Martinis are a must try for starters. Decent pricing and totally worth it!	1
Awesome. One of the best IPAs I've ever had, and I've had a lot. Sandwiches are amazing and HUGE. Prices are more than reasonable for what you get. Good staff, knowledgable and attentive. When they say something is spicy, they mean it, but it's good as long as you can handle heat. Will make this a regular stop when I am in Pittsburgh.	1
This place is good, but way overpriced. This place is a rip off. The prices aren't listed, they are extremely overpriced, and the service is not that great. The employees get you to upgrade and pay more for almost nothing, I do not reccommend this place & I will not come back. Way too expensive. I don't know how they stay in business	0
Stopped in for the first time yesterday and I was extremely impressed. I live right down the street from Biscuits but I only noticed it a couple weeks ago. The menu was fairly extensive and had anything you could want as far as breakfast goes. I went with Joe's Scramble which came with a choice of toast, biscuits, or pancakes. I chose the biscuits (comes with 2) and all my food was very good. I'm not sure if the rest of the menu comes in such large portions but I wasn't even able to finish the whole meal. Everything was in the $7-10 price range; more than reasonable for the quality. I'd recommend this place to anyone, especially if you don't feel like waiting to be seated at one of the more crowded breakfast places in Tempe.	1
You basically get three comedians for the price of one. There is an emcee who does a short set, an "opening act" comedian who does a longer set and finally the headliner who does a full set. I saw Graham Elwood who was great and Nick Griffin who was even funnier (and has a FML style of comedy that seemed to work better with those of us in our 20s-30s than with the geezers in the crowd). Of course how good or bad the comedians you see are will make or break the night. I went on a Tuesday and it was about 1/2 to 2/3 full (but this is Vegas so I assume most of us were there on vacation). We got buy one get one free tickets from a Harrahs coupon book you receive when you sign up for the free Player's Club card. Otherwise tickets are about $30One final thing...beware that the drinks at the Improv are about the same size drinks you get from the cocktail waitress in the casino itself...they just charge you $9 for them! So if you are going to gamble at Harrahs before the show you might just want to get a few drinks and save your $$.	1
I've only eaten here once.  It was an interesting spot for the restaurant, hidden away among a facade that did not strike me as an Irish pub/restaurant.  However, once you step inside it is obvious what this place is.  It is very charming and almost makes me want to purchase a pint right there.  I do my best to stop the urge.The seating is odd; we are taken off to another room that I must admit is much nicer to sit in than the bar area.  As the band was showing up right as we were leaving, I could see it getting quite loud in the bar area but could be not nearly as bad in the back room.I wasn't that hungry to begin with but one look down the menu had me ordering Beef Stew w/ Guiness.  I was thinking soup more than stew for some reason so when a huge bowl was served to me, I was taken aback.  Had I been hungrier, I would've eaten much more, but instead my companion was asking me if I was gonna eat that.  That was a first!I didn't partake in the alcohol consumption here (saved my money for Casino Royale) but the choices seemed plentiful and the bar would be fun when a band is there.  The cost is reasonable and you get what you pay for.  I'll be coming back, hopefully sooner than later.	1
Tough menu.  A lot of choices, so I was vacillating a lot.  I finally decided on the Ahi Tuna sandwich with sweet potato fries.  I also ordered the beet salad just to try it.  I liked everything.  Including the onion rings the hubbie ordered.  This would be the place I would go for onion rings.  Very tasty.We sat outside. Not sure if it would be enjoyable in summer, but mid-Feb, with it finally hitting the upper 70s, it was wonderful.  Several people were there w/ dogs because it is really a picnic area.We will go back.  I want to try the ahi salad...maybe stick w/ the ahi sandwich.  I think it will be the way to go when I'm craving a burger.W/o a doubt, if you go, you HAVE to check out the bathrooms.	1
Worst service! Ordered a hot fudge banana shake and instead got a Sunday. Instead of being nice about it the girl told me I ordered it wrong but she would remake it for me.	0
i work in the neighborhood and have seen this place for years, but for some reason didn't stop in until today.  i wish i had tried this place sooner! i was surprised to find they offer a LOT more than just pizza, like pasta, salads, subs, chicken wings and chicken fingers too.  so anyway i had the gyro sandwich and was really happy with my choice.  the gyro meat was not greasy tasting at all, and the sour cream tzatziki (spelling?!) sauce and garnishes were just right.  i will definitely come back to try the pizza or other offerings	1
Oh my ...dont like the food here. Tried the Pad thai and the chicken fried rice ...the pad thai was disgusting and the fried rice was not enticing either ...wont be going back ...ugh	0
EPIC! Great place to hang out. Fun staff and nice environment. Start with the pretzels or steak nachos then get the chicken. Mac and cheese rocks too!	1
I've been here a few times. Mostly its been good. But, There is only one good thing I can say about my experience with Maggiano's this last time. The Waitress was great. She was on the ball all night.But, The meal was horrible. I could not believe how bad it was. It wasn't just one thing. It was everything. From the bread to the Wine. Yes, even the Wine was bad. I couldn't finish the meal. And no. I did not take a to go box.They must have a new Juan or Hector cooking the food in the kitchen.  It certainly didn't taste like an Italian was cooking.Terrible meal	0
The receptionist was so nice! It was my first time seeing her, and she was super friendly and attentive. I always get my eyebrows done by Lila because she is the best.  Shes not too rough, and she's very consistent with her work.	1
they make smaller tables wait longer to be sat and the food is not that great you can get better food at mid level steakhouse	0
Horrible just horrible. Aren't they suppose to clean your teeth? I hate going to businesses with lazy workers. The Doctor is lazy. Go elsewhere for better work.	0
Just came back from that festival. I don t want to be bad. We are from Europe. This is a real joke. Between charlemagne ( 8th century), the elephants, and the renaissance it is almost 600 years between!  You pay 20 dollars for what! Park your car maybe in rocks!.you must pay everything inside. 1 dol to 6 dol at least. Just for rides. Family of 6. It hurts!. + food(awfull) drinks( I am not sure they put any alcohol in the cocktails($6 each). Go once and never go back. Good luck!	0
